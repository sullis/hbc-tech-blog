At AWS re:Invent, Emerson Loureiro, Senior Software Engineer at Gilt, lead two well-received sessions on our journey from a single monolithic Rails application to more than 300 Scala/Java microservices deployed in the cloud. We learned many important lessons along the way so we're very happy to share this video of Emerson's talk with you.
