We'll be hosting our first meetup of 2017 in partnership with the [NYC Scrum User Group](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Scrum-User-Group/events/232541163/) on Thursday, January 19th. This is our first time hosting this group and we're off to a great start: Ken Rubin will be joining us to lead a talk on Agile. 

More on Ken: 

_Ken is the author of Amazon’s #1 best selling book Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process. As an agile thought leader, he founded Innolution where he helps organizations thrive through the application of agile principles in an effective and economically sensible way.

He was the first managing director of the worldwide Scrum Alliance, a nonprofit organization focused on transforming the world of work using Scrum._

The title of the talk is "Agile Transition Lessons That Address Practical Questions" and will address questions like: 

- Is there a way to quantify the cost of the transition?
- How many teams or what scope should the initial transition effort cover?
- Should we use an internal coach or hire an external coach?
- How does training fit in to the adoption?
- How do we measure our success?
- Should we use an existing scaling framework or develop our own? 

If you plan to attend, please RSVP on the [NYC Scrum User Group Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Scrum-User-Group/events/232541163/). As always there will be refreshments, networking opportunities and a chance to chat with the speaker. We hope to see you there!
