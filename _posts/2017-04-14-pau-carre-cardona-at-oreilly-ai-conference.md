The [O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference](https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny) is coming to New York City in June. From June 27-29, the top minds in AI will be meeting for "a deep dive into emerging AI techniques and technologies with a focus on how to use it in real-world implementations." 

We are excited that one of our software engineers, Pau Carre Cardona, will be leading a session as part of the "Implementing AI" track on June 29. Pau's talk will expand upon his widely read [blog post](http://tech.gilt.com/machine/learning,/deep/learning/2016/12/22/deep-learning-at-gilt) on how we have applied deep learning at Gilt to complete tasks that require human-level cognitive skills. He'll touch on how we have leveraged Facebook’s open source [Torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch) implementation of Microsoft’s [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1) for image classification and his open-source project [TiefVision](https://github.com/paucarre/tiefvision) which is used to detect image similarity.

You can find more details on Pau's session here: [Deep Learning in the Fashion Industry](https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/59111).
