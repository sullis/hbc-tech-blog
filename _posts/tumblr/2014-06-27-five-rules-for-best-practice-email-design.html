<p>Email Build Specialist/Front-End Developer Lauren Ribando is one of the key people behind the creation of Gilt&rsquo;s beautiful daily emails. Recently Sitepoint asked her to share some best practices for creating well-designed emails. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first, it might seem that the best way to preserve the design of an email is to throw it all in an image tag or slice it up into lots of images. Then there’s no need to worry about being limited to ugly system fonts or stripping of the background images, right?</p>
<p>Not quite. An image-heavy email will increase the chances of your email client flagging it as spam, resulting in damage to your sender reputation.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the best way to avoid ending up in the dreaded Spam folder is to make sure that your emails reflect a balanced image to text ratio.</p>
