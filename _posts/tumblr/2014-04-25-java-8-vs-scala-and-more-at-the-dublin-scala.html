<p>The Gilt engineering team in Dublin hosts the next <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/dublin+scala+users+group" target="_blank">Dublin Scala Users Group</a> meetup this coming Wednesday (April 30) at Engine Yard&rsquo;s offices! This installment of the Dublin SUG&ndash;an earlier gathering of which you see above (that&rsquo;s Principal Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/gregor+heine" target="_blank">Gregor Heine</a> giving the lowdown on Scala self-types)&ndash;features talks by Gilt and Workday as well as beer, pizza, and lots of awesome engineers.</p>
<p>More on those talks:</p>
<ul><li><em><strong>Gilt Software Engineer Chavdar Chernashki on &ldquo;Java 8 vs. Scala.&rdquo;</strong> </em>According to Scala creator Martin Odersky, &ldquo;Java 8 represents one of the most significant changes to the language in its history, with new constructs that will change the traditional ways Java developers have approached solving problems.&rdquo; In this talk, Chavdar will examine how the new concepts incorporated in Java 8&ndash;already available in Scala&ndash;could profoundly change the way we write software. He&rsquo;ll discuss Java 8’s new features, using both Java’s proposed syntax and Scala. He&rsquo;ll cover lambda expressions, higher-order functions, parallel collections and virtual extension methods (aka traits). Finally, he&rsquo;ll provide insight into the new paradigms integrated in Java 8, such as functional programming.</li>
