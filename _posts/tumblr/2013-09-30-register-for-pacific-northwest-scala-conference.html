<p>Gilt&rsquo;s proud to be a sponsor of the <a href="http://pnwscala.org" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest Scala Conference</a>, which will bring together Scala enthusiasts from the Pacific Northwest and other areas for two days of short talks about a wide range of Scala-related topics. Hosted Oct. 19-20 at the Leftbank Annex in Portland, Ore., PNWScala will feature presentations on &ldquo;JavaScript for Scala Nerds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Akka in Production,&rdquo; Spire, functional raster image processing, and <a href="http://pnwscala.org/schedule/" target="_blank">much more</a>. Giving the keynote will be <a href="https://twitter.com/extempore2" target="_blank">Paul Phillips</a>, who will discuss how &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Doing It All Wrong&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My conclusion after moving a million lines of code is that everything we do (plus or minus) is wrong. Henry Ford said &ldquo;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&rdquo; Our horses are now a billion times faster: our horses may well be the fastest in the galaxy. Are we too comfortable on our horses? Would we recognize better mounts if they came along, but didn&rsquo;t look like horses? Is the state of our profession one which warrants pride, shame, or despair? I will explore these questions with unwarranted optimism.</p>
