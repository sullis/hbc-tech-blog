<p>We&rsquo;re excited to welcome <span class="il">Brendan</span> St. John to the Gilt Tech fold! Brendan works out of our Dublin office and is part of our test architecture team.</p>
<p>Before joining Gilt, Brendan worked on a mobile payments platform; prior to that, he spent time doing test automation and systems administration. In addition to programming in Java, he has experience developing small projects with Ruby and C#. He also knows some Scala&ndash;our favorite programming language&ndash;after participating in our recent, <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/30/interested-in-free-scala-training-at-gilts-dublin" target="_blank">free Scala course</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Brendan flies paragliders if it&rsquo;s not rainy or windy. &ldquo;I learned while I was living in New Zealand and needed a hobby between ski seasons,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The mountains and climate made it ideal over there, but I still manage to get out a good bit in Ireland, especially with summers like the great one we just had.&rdquo;</p>
