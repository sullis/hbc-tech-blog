<p>#gilttech is excited and honored to host a talk by <span>W. Eric L. Grimson PhD, the Chancellor for Academic Advancement at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology! On Thursday, July 17, we will present &ldquo;MIT: Under the Dome,&rdquo; an interactive discussion with <span>Chancellor Grimson that will </span>include a brief history of MIT and the breadth of the Institute&rsquo;s impact around the world. Chancellor Grimson will also address MIT&rsquo;s intention to liberate human potential for innovation, on campus and worldwide. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>In addition to being an MIT faculty member since 1984 and a past chancellor (2011-2013), Chancellor Grimson has also served as Head of MIT&rsquo;s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (2005-2011) and is a member of the school&rsquo;s </span><span>Computer Vision Group (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory), among other distinctions. He championed <a href="http://www.mitx.org/" target="_blank">MITx</a> and the formation of the Office of Digital Learning; teaches 6.00x, one of the first MITx courses, to more than 200,000 registrants; and has served as thesis supervisor to approximately 50 MIT PhDs. </span></p>
<p><span>Whether you&rsquo;re a software engineer, a computer science student or just curious about the latest innovations underway at one of the world&rsquo;s most elite academic institutions, this event will be a don&rsquo;t-miss! Gilt&rsquo;s NYC office will host the event; doors open at 6:30 PM. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Gilt-Tech-Events/events/192634562/" target="_blank">To RSVP, just go here</a>.<br/></span></p>
