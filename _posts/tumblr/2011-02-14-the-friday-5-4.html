<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4232161003164947">Few people would argue the importance of great communication across a development organization. It’s vital that developers are aware of the work of their peers&ndash;not only the “what,&ldquo; but also the “how” and “why.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span><span>Achieving this is easier said than done. Traditional approaches such as wiki documentation, meeting minutes, email lists and chat channels have value, but also have significant drawbacks.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>We’ve been experimenting with a new approach at Gilt: The Friday 5@4. This is an informal end-of-week gathering where each team and active project presents something that they’ve done since the last meeting, typically with a live demo. Talks are strictly time-boxed to 5 minutes for the demo, 3 minutes for questions.</span><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgh73cVw9J1qg275c.jpg"/><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Developers are encouraged to show features in action, discuss their technical design and show code snippets. Rehearsed, PowerPoint presentations are discouraged.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So far it has helped developers understand what their peers are up to, and provides an excuse to talk shop over a beer or two. It’s also been a lot of fun.</span></span></p>
