<p><span>Based on the feedback we receive from <a href="http://gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt</a> customers, we know that fit and sizing varies greatly between brands&ndash;which can make finding the </span><span>right </span><span>size very challenging. We always want our customers to feel great about their purchases and confident that an item will fit. With this in mind, we are excited to announce the launch of Fit Predictor: a new technology from our partners at </span><a href="http://secretsaucepartners.com/" target="_blank">Secret Sauce</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span></span>With Fit Predictor, simply tell us which sizes fit you best in some (or all) of your favorite brands. Based on the stats you provide, and the items from your fave brands that you select, we will calculate and recommend the right sizes for you. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>While checking out select items on Gilt, you will notice the Fit Predictor above the size selections:</span><img alt="image" height="95px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3qjgzrxb7Ztc_-GdXkct0U3nVaXWkhmZaEQGk818mujGYZLYyo3x4PhqrMtRFGlBhGlW6VFWGA-J0sqW00AALX5SLpgATHtIilhJmFI_8MHVBKo-k-ybXoiqHHCd67I6zQ" width="297px;"/></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>Click “calculate your size” to choose a brand that you know, an item type, and the size that fits you:</span><img alt="image" height="350px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FoaRFrtOXOTxswipLxwjzmLoXkM77V_O6xh9AKLunyjrjYp6fOsgLZzBUhC9Ste-D7D0Krte5s6sTYYjK8JOe4haUMtDzjjt-znqbSQkksZ5f5O2DUoD9c8kgNcKO2BplQ" width="336px;"/></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>Based on your input, Fit Predictor will recommend the size that will best fit you for the item you are currently viewing:</span><img alt="image" height="294px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6uzkv2EZ-qBIIDvUd1ka7YAeIwS3eaWZRETEYH8xzvy-cWA_DvA7aHBKhZog6ZGY9bRy3SiFCPI3SY9ezoyJE2i3VojVOBubp-WAion-oOdVEjCPIDwjC8YspjpwREKibw" width="321px;"/></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>The more sizing information about your favorite brands that you share with Fit Predictor, the better predictions we can make. Over time, build up your fit profile and receive the most accurate recommendations:</span><img alt="image" height="232px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gq8BHVD5-Ou0nXZGwKoKVDMMFd5IptXL9y5-IrFHvx5M6k6C32OM1c7RpkcBnRuS48mH9z4voZGT3G0ENdxbPgIs2TMJ5i8U5qz-LIegLyw-Qs6h43Z16tbCDw6Bz4g-qw" width="320px;"/></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>With a Fit Profile, every time you navigate to a product that is enabled by Fit Predictor, we will automatically suggest the best size for you:</span><span><br/></span><span><img alt="image" height="110px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vbN_zIytBjlCysc22ukISJ0tL6vHV1lYIxVpE-M6NHsvvaXItUIUx7INgPr4IueryuF3Q1jEip-NckoHYaMobuW6RIVi4MMreSN_GHWyBo9JQ8q5H0rY9eLPLt3bOiFaNw" width="253px;"/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>We will be working hard to roll out Fit Predictor to as many items as possible, so you can always take advantage of its magic!</span></p>
