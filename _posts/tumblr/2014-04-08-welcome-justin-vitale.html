<p>We&rsquo;re excited to add <strong>Justin Vitale</strong> to Gilt&rsquo;s Program Management Office! Justin joined Gilt in May 2011 as a member of our IT department, and very recently made the switch to our PMO. He&rsquo;ll continue working on IT projects and bringing along his fancy furniture, including his red velvet rope, wherever he goes. <em><br/></em></p>
<p>Originally (&ldquo;and proudly!&rdquo;) from the Jersey Shore, Justin has lived in NYC since 2007. Outside of work he &ldquo;lives and breathes&rdquo; hockey and golf. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been playing both sports since I was eight or nine, and I won&rsquo;t stop until my legs literally fall off,&rdquo; he says. We&rsquo;re committed to helping Justin to keep his limbs attached, so we&rsquo;ve already started him off on a strict athletic regimen that includes some of his longtime favorite sports as well as some <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/03/25/the-2014-gilt-plasma-prix-the-movie" target="_blank">brand-new ones</a>.</p>
