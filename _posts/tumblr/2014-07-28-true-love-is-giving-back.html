<p><span><a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/gilt+insider" target="_blank">Gilt Insider</a>, our customer loyalty program, just turned one year old, and to celebrate we&rsquo;re sharing presents!</span></p>
<p>Today all Insider benefits are half-off—meaning 2x the payback for your hard-earned points. This works for dollars off any order, free shipping, or even products in our curated rewards shops.</p>

<p><span>As a refresher: Insider members earn five points for every dollar spent on Gilt. These points can be redeemed either as cash, or for a rotating array of products, deals, and gift cards for our favorite brands.</span></p>
