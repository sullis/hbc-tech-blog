<p>Recently we announced that our resident Scala experts in <strong>Dublin</strong> will <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/30/interested-in-free-scala-training-at-gilts-dublin" target="_blank">teach a free, one-day beginners-level Scala course</a> on August 30 and September 13. Now we have some exciting news for the <strong>NYC</strong> tech community: on Monday, September 9 our Manhattan office will host a free Introduction to Machine Learning course taught by <a href="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/" target="_blank">John Myles White</a>. The TL; DR version&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, September 9, 2013 from 10AM-6PM</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Gilt, 2 Park Ave., 5th Floor</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> Gilt technologists, possibly you</p>
<p><strong>About the course:</strong> This one-day class will cover the basics of machine learning concepts such as regression, classification and data reduction. It will also touch upon some specific topics around recommendations/personalization applications and Bayesian networks. The course will be more algorithmic than mathematics-intensive, so if you&rsquo;re a bit rusty on your calculus and linear algebra you can still keep up with the class.</p>
<p><strong>About John Myles White:</strong> John is the author of several books (including <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do" target="_blank"><em>Machine Learning for Hackers</em></a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do" target="_blank"><em>Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization</em></a>); the author of <a href="http://projecttemplate.net/" target="_blank">ProjectTemplate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/log4r" target="_blank">log4r</a> packages for R; a developer of the <a href="http://julialang.org/" target="_blank">Julia programming language</a>; a <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/" target="_blank">Hacker School</a> resident; and an organizer of the <a href="http://datagotham.com/" target="_blank">DataGotham</a> conference. He earned his Ph.D. in Psychology from Princeton. We&rsquo;re glad to catch him right before he moves west to become a data scientist at Facebook.</p>
