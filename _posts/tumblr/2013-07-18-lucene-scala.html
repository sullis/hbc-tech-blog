<p>Please say hello to <a href="https://github.com/gilt/lib-lucene-sugar" target="_blank">Lucene Sugar</a>: a library that provides a more concise syntax for the Lucene API in the Scala language. Lucene Sugar makes it easier to:</p>
<ul><li>compose Lucene indexes using the familiar Scala cake pattern</li>
<li>add indexed and/or stored fields to a Lucene document</li>
<li>index collections of documents</li>
<li>search! (You didn’t really expect that, did you?)</li>
</ul><p>My general goal for Lucene Sugar is to turn some standard operations on their head. For example, instead of:</p>
<p><code>scala val doc = new Document doc.add(new StringField("string_field", "aString", Store.YES)) doc.add(new LongField("long_field", 123456L, Store.NO)) doc.add(new StoredField("int_field", 10))</code></p>
<p>you can now write:</p>
<p><code>scala val doc = new Document doc.addIndexedStoredField("string_field", "aString") doc.addIndexedOnlyField("long_field", 123456L) doc.addStoredOnlyField("int_field", 10)</code></p>
<p>Lucene Sugar is still in its infancy, but I believe it already offers great value to anyone wishing to use Lucene in Scala code.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Created Sugar<br/></strong></p>
<p>Gilt&rsquo;s inventory includes millions of different items in limited quantities. These items are sold quickly, which means that our inventory is constantly changing. A few weeks ago I found that I needed a data store capable of:</p>
<ul><li>storing items composed of text and numbers</li>
<li>being indexed and filtered using extremely specific criteria (for example, all white shirts from Paul Smith that can be shipped to Canada)</li>
<li>working quickly and efficiently (a few 100ms per query)</li>
<li>being embeddable (I wanted the data management to be self-contained in the service without requiring any external dependencies</li>
</ul><p>I&rsquo;d used Lucene for other projects, and thought it might be a great fit for what I needed. In fact, it turned out that&ndash;despite its wordy API&ndash;Lucene works very well. To overcome the excess verbiage issue, I added some &ldquo;Scala syntactic sugar&rdquo; around the Lucene API to make it more concise and pleasant to use. After doing some coding, I realized that it could be helpful to convert this higher-level API into a library that could be reused in other projects. (I also badly wanted to publish my first open source Scala project, so this was a very good candidate.)</p>
<p>With Lucene Sugar, we can now build a search and browser service on top of our inventory data; the data is composed of textual attributes such as product name, brand, color and description as well as numeric data like price and size. I hope you find it useful as well!</p>
