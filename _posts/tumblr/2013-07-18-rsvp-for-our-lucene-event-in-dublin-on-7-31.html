<p>Gilt Tech is excited to announce that on Wed 7/31, we&rsquo;ll host a don&rsquo;t-miss Lucene presentation featuring LucidWorks CTO/cofounder <a href="https://twitter.com/gsingers" target="_blank">Grant Ingersoll </a>and Gilt Senior Engineer Ugo Matrangolo. This free event will take place at TCube, 32-34 Castle St., Dublin 2 and include pizza and beer. Doors open at 6:30 PM, with presentations beginning at 7 PM. <a href="https://tito.io/tcube/apache-lucene-hosted-by-Gilt-Groupe" target="_blank">Go here to RSVP</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to his role at LucidWorks, Ingersoll is a Lucene and Solr committer and long-standing member of the Apache Software Foundation. He&rsquo;ll discuss the latest and greatest capabilities in Lucene and Solr related to relevance, distributed search, and faceting, and explain how to leverage these capabilities to build fast, efficient, scalable, next-generation data driven applications. Matrangolo, a member of Gilt&rsquo;s Stores Team, has played a vital role in developing and enhancing the Gilt&rsquo;s search capabilities, and will focus on how Solr has enabled Gilt to provide a controlled and targeted search experience for its millions of customers in the face of intense, daily spikes in site traffic.</p>
<p>Please join us for what promises to be an enlightening and lively discussion!</p>
