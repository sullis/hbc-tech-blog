<p>Earlier this week we became co-organizers and sponsors of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-iOS-Office-Hours/" target="_blank">iOS Office Hours</a>: a bimonthly, two-hour meetup for folks seeking help with iOS and Objective-C programming. Created by the team at <a href="https://twitter.com/codecoalition" target="_blank">Code Coalition</a> (they&rsquo;re changing their name from <a href="http://bitfountaincode.com/" target="_blank">BitFountain</a>), iOS Office Hours began meeting in March 2013 and quickly outgrew its meeting space. Office Hours founders Eliot Arntz and Teddy Wyly teach iOS workshops at the <a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/09/kanye-west-general-assembly-startup-nyc-flatiron-cruel-summer/" target="_blank">Kanye-approved</a> learning center <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly </a>and have taught programming in underserved communities. We&rsquo;re excited to work with them!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be kicking off our partnership with a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-iOS-Office-Hours/events/132368172/" target="_blank">Tue 8/13 meetup</a> featuring short talks by Gilt Principal Software Engineer Evan Maloney and members of the Code Coalition crew, followed by casual Q&amp;A with resident experts from both companies. Bring your laptop and your questions about iPhone development, and we&rsquo;ll help you try to solve your latest development problems. All skill levels are welcome.</p>
