<p>Gilt Lead Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/yoni+goldberg" target="_blank">Yoni Goldberg</a> traveled all the way to Boulder, Colo. this weekend to present at <a href="http://www.degoesconsulting.com/lambdaconf/" target="_blank">LambdaConf</a>, a full-day conference featuring functional programming-related talks and workshops. Yoni&rsquo;s talk focuses on the evolution of Gilt&rsquo;s architecture from a monolithic Rails app to a distributed Scala micro-services system. Check out an earlier version of his presentation (from NYC Tech Talks earlier this year) below!</p>
