<p><strong>Action Shot:</strong> A group of Gilt software engineers gathered &lsquo;roun the television this afternoon to watch <a href="http://www.typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Introducing <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/news/2014/01/21/slick-2.0.0-released.html" target="_blank">Slick 2.0.0</a>&rdquo; webinar. We&rsquo;re considering using Slick in one of our new projects and found the webinar really helpful&ndash;especially the use cases that Slick tech lead/instructor Stefan Zeiger provided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stefan provides an example of a fairly complicated for-comprehension using Slick, and his slides make what is happening under the sugar easy to understand,&rdquo; says Myyk Seok, an engineer on our back office team. &ldquo;The talk left me confident that I would be able to leave Squeryl/Anorm and write my next service with Slick instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did you watch too?</p>
