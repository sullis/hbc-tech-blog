<p>Come to Gilt on Wed 3/5 (6:30 PM) for the Hackers Union&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyhacker/events/167595832/" target="_blank">third Hacker Forum</a>: an evening of conversation and lightning talks by Gilt engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/10/04/welcome-jonathan-leibiusky" target="_blank">Jonathan Leibiusky</a> and Huffington Post engineer Mike Adler. More on the featured presentations:</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Exploring Docker at Gilt&rdquo;</em></strong>: Jon <span>Leibiusky</span><br/><span>Over the past few months, a team of engineers at Gilt has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.docker.io/" target="_blank">Docker</a>: an exciting new open source engine that makes it possible to create and run applications in their own lightweight containers. (You might call it &ldquo;worry-free continuous deployment.&rdquo;) In this short talk, Jon will describe what Docker is, what it does, and why Gilt has joined other companies in exploring this promising new technology despite its not-quite-finished state. He&rsquo;ll also briefly discuss some of the ways that Docker stands to compliment Gilt&rsquo;s distinctive micro-services architecture (450 applications and counting), and some of the discoveries he and his colleagues have made during their work.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>&ldquo;The Perfect Provisioning Tool&rdquo;</em></strong>: Mike Adler<br/><span>Mike Adler will facetiously define the criteria for the perfect provisioning tool. The talk is oriented towards service-oriented architecture on IaaS vendors like Amazon. Mike will discuss the merits of a few available tools and introduce AWSHeet, which is a handy, if imperfect, way to provision resources.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We&rsquo;ll have pizza and beer for everyone&ndash;don&rsquo;t miss it! RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyhacker/events/167595832/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></span></p>
