<p>You&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/tagged/Special-Operations" target="_blank">their amazing blog posts</a> (if you know what&rsquo;s good for you)&ndash;now hear the Gilt Special Operations team LIVE as they share their expertise and tips with the NYC tech community. On Monday, October 27, Special Ops team members (left to right) Gregory Mazurek, Jose Sanchez and Kyle Dorman will describe the process of &ldquo;responsivizing&rdquo; Gilt&rsquo;s complex website. If you&rsquo;re a front-end engineer, a UX designer, or a product manager, you won&rsquo;t want to miss this talk!</p>
<p>Greg will discuss how to organize media queries, and explain why his team used in-selector CSS media-queries instead of blocks. Kyle will share how the team discovered and implemented one of their favorite design patterns, the full-screen modal. And Jose will discuss how and why Special Ops wrote Selenium-automated tests for each browser responsive breakpoint.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s presentation takes place at 2 Park Avenue and is cohosted by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Gilt-Tech-Events/events/206471962/" target="_blank">Gilt Tech</a> and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/rwd-nyc/events/206587252/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a> meetup; RSVP through either group. We&rsquo;ll have food, drinks, and mingling time (and lots of people to mingle <em>with </em>&ndash; 300 RSVPs between the two groups, and counting).</p>
