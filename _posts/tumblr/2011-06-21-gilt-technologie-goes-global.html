<p class="p1">Gilt Technologie is all about leveraging leading-edge technology to build and operate the most reliable and scalable e-commerce platform in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1">However, recently, the organization took on a whole new challenge - maximize our ability to attract the very best in talent world-wide by building out a truly distributed, global engineering organization. To fulfill that goal, we&rsquo;re heavily investing in our two new software development centers located in <a title="Software Dev Center in Portland" href="http://www.gilt.com/careers/tech/2011/04/14/portland/?cat=tech%20" target="_blank">Portland, Oregon</a> and <a title='"3G" Engineering - Dublin, Ireland' href="http://irelandjobs.gilt.com" target="_blank">Dublin, Ireland</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Developing software in a single location is fun and challenging in itself but imagine doing the same with colleagues from around the world - that just adds a whole new dimension to the picture. To jump start this, we're thinking about creating a week-long &ldquo;follow-the-sun&rdquo; Hack-a-thon, where globally distributed teams will work on solutions and innovations that would typically be hard to deliver (in the given timeframe) from a single team within a single timezone.</p>
<p class="p1">Getting this just right will definitely be hard to accomplish, but if we do, we&rsquo;ll end up with a much more scalable organization with incredibly experienced engineers. A win-win for everyone!</p>
<p class="p1">Stay tuned to follow our adventure or better yet: Join Gilt to join the fun!!</p>
