<p>Given our love for <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/docker" target="_blank">Docker</a>&ndash;not to mention Principal Systems Engineer Jonathan Leibiusky&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/golang" target="_blank">recent open source work</a>)&ndash;the topic of our next <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/free+tech+courses" target="_blank">free tech course</a> is super-exciting and also timely. <a href="http://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a> is an open-source programming language aimed at increasing developer productivity. During this class, we will explore the benefits of programming in Go and learn the basics. By the end of the day, you will have built:</p>
<ul><li>A basic webapp using only the built-in standard libraries</li>
<li>A more sophisticated web app that supplements the Go standard library</li>
<li>with some third-party tools</li>
<li>A web scraper for some basic data analysis</li>
<li>A tool for conducting basic natural-language processing in Go</li>
</ul><p><strong>Prior experience programming in an imperative language is necessary for the course.</strong></p>
<p>Teaching the session is Aditya Mukerjee, who has been writing Go professionally since the first stable release of the language, and is an author of several open-source Go libraries.</p>
