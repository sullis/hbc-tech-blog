<p>Here&rsquo;s Gilt Lead Software Engineer Will Chiong presenting at last night&rsquo;s #gilttech-hosted <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/05/23/full-stack-engineering-comes-back-to-gilt-this-tuesday" target="_blank">Full-Stack Engineering</a> meetup on our ongoing personalization efforts. In this short talk, Will gives an overview of how his team summarizes customer behavior data and uses that data to make recommendations. Thanks to Will and the night&rsquo;s other speakers&ndash;Mike Brittain of Etsy and Wes Chow of Chartbeat&ndash;as well as all our guests! (Bonus thanks to friend-of-Gilt Mike P. for sharing this Google Glass video.)</p>
