<p>Over the summer Gilt&rsquo;s tech team had the honor of working with Nikita Rau, a participant in the Summer Immersion Program run by the nonprofit <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/08/26/meet-a-gilt-technologist-nikita-and-diana" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>. Nikita is an 18-year-old student at the Bronx High School of Science and an aspiring computer science major &hellip; and, now, a bit of a celebrity as well! The popular magazine <em>Fast Company </em>just published a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3021466/a-girl-who-codes" target="_blank">lengthy feature article</a> on Nikita that highlights her work with XX Hackers&ndash;a coding club for girls that she started in 2012&ndash;and participation in GWC&rsquo;s amazing programs. Congrats to Nikita!</p>
