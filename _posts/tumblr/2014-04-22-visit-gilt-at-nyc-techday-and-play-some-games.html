<p>Gilt is one of more than 400 tech companies exhibiting at this year&rsquo;s <a href="https://nytechday.com/" target="_blank">NYC TechDay</a>&ndash;a start-up science fair at Pier 92 that TechDay organizers claim is &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s largest start-up event.&rdquo; This year more than 11,000 people RSVPed to attend&ndash;and we want to meet them all!</p>
<p>Registration is free, so if you live anywhere near New York City go ahead and <a href="https://nytechday.com/attendees/signup" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. A delegation from Gilt&rsquo;s Tech team&ndash;including half the mobile team from 3 to 5 PM&ndash;will be hanging out at our booth to answer your questions, hand out swag and play board games with our guests. All the fun begins at 9 AM and runs through 5:30 PM.</p>
