<p>Yesterday Santa Claus stopped by our Park Avenue office to meet with our tech team and ask us about our shipping operations. Seems that Santa has become frustrated with his traditional delivery-by-reindeer approach and wanted some of our expert opinions on how to distribute presents to people faster and with less chafing (from the chimneys, obvs) and false burglary arrests (when <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/12/18/santa/" target="_blank">chimney entry isn&rsquo;t possible</a>). We were surprised to find out that recently he has begun exploring adoption of <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/robots" target="_blank">Kiva robots</a> and other technologies related to speedier merch-moving and shipping.</p>
<p>During his visit, Santa posed for photographs with some of our tech team and even participated in our afternoon <strong>cookie-decorating</strong> session. Here he is with Gilt Application Support Director Kent Helbig, who couldn&rsquo;t pass up an opportunity to promote our <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23carpeholiday&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#carpeholiday</a> hashtag:</p>
