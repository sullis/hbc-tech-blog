<p>If you&rsquo;re a practicing iOS developer who lives in NYC (or who plans on parachuting in over the weekend), don&rsquo;t miss Monday&rsquo;s iOSoho meetup. The night&rsquo;s featured presenter is Gilt Principal Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/evan+maloney" target="_blank">Evan Coyne Maloney</a>, who <span>will discuss how to gracefully handle changes to your server-side data model and also give a preview of Mockingbird: </span><span>the platform on which Gilt&rsquo;s iPhone and iPad apps are built, and which we plan on releasing as open source sometime before the end of the year. Seats are almost gone, so <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iOSoho/events/181963632/" target="_blank">RSVP here</a>.</span></p>
