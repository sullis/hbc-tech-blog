<p>This week many a Gilt technologist could be found folding pieces of paper into exotic shapes that either soared like eagles or tottered around like penguins (depending). The purpose: To participate in #gilttech&rsquo;s inaugural paper airplane contest.</p>
<p>The team in Dublin went first, holding their contest on Thursday:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/72ac2edb55fe32e664b24ff91d695358/tumblr_inline_nf1yl9btKC1s17bu5.jpg" width="800"/></p>
<p>Above are our Dublin victors (left to right): Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/pawel+raszewski" target="_blank">Pawel Raszewski</a>, whose plane won the &ldquo;longest distance traveled&rdquo; category at 54 feet (Pawel&rsquo;s our resident <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/08/01/welcome-pawel-raszewski" target="_blank">aviation expert</a>); Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/natalia+bartol" target="_blank">Natalia Bartol</a>, who won &ldquo;longest airtime&rdquo; at 3.6 seconds; and Senior Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/rory+haddon" target="_blank">Rory Haddon</a>, who swept all four &ldquo;creative&rdquo; categories (&ldquo;most beautiful,&rdquo; &ldquo;most Gilt,&rdquo; &ldquo;most creative overall&rdquo; and &ldquo;most team&rdquo;). Rory was the sole contender in three of those four categories, facing a challenge only in &ldquo;most team&rdquo; from &ldquo;Team Fire,&rdquo; led by Senior Software Engineer Conor Clifford. &ldquo;Team Fire&rsquo;s actual flaming entry posed a health-and-safety risk,&rdquo; writes Senior Program Manager Deirdre O'Brien; somehow this fact cost Conor and his team some points with the judges.</p>
<p>From the starting line:</p>

<p>A space made for plane-flying:</p>

<p>Rory&rsquo;s fiery-yet-fire-code-compliant aircraft:</p>

<p>Now we turn our attention to the NYC iteration of this historic competition. How the NYC contest differed from Dublin&rsquo;s:</p>
<ul><li>each contestant flew his/her plane solo and received two tries each for the &ldquo;longest distance&rdquo; and &ldquo;longest airtime&rdquo; categories</li>
<li>only one general &ldquo;creative&rdquo; category, not four (controversial question: Is #gilttech-Dublin more creative than #gilttech-NYC?)</li>
<li>lack of measuring instrument meant that no distances could be accuratedly recorded in NYC; &ldquo;the Giltemeter,&rdquo; our own distance-measuring standard, didn&rsquo;t really catch on (one Giltemeter = the length of Senior Director, Back Office Engineering and contest visionary <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/christopher+hazlett" target="_blank">Christopher Hazlett</a>&rsquo;s boot)</li>
<li>what we lacked in measuring tape we made up for in the use of tiny multicolored Post-Its to mark distances traveled by planes</li>
</ul><p>Unlike Dublin&rsquo;s beautiful and spacious flying area, our NYC contest course consisted of a long hallway apparently engineered specifically to accommodate paper airplane contests, but nothing else. At least it kept us focused!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an action shot with Senior Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/robert+brazier" target="_blank">Robert Brazier</a> and his plane&ndash;possibly on its victory flight?:</p>

<p>Lead Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/paolo+lim" target="_blank">Paolo Lim</a> takes his turn in the &ldquo;longest airtime&rdquo; category while other contestants look on:</p>

<p>In the end, Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/06/25/welcome-evan-wall" target="_blank">Evan Wall</a> won the distance category; Robert Brazier won the &ldquo;longest airtime&rdquo; with 2.7 seconds (Natalia won this category overall); and Software Engineering Intern/Scalasaur <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/helena+wu" target="_blank">Helena Wu</a> (above photo, far left) won the most creative. Lead Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/eric+shepherd" target="_blank">Eric Shepherd</a>, at far right, came in third in the creative category. Helena&rsquo;s plane is the striped and dotted one in the foreground of the photo below, and Eric&rsquo;s is the one on the right.</p>

<p>And that <em>Top Gun</em>-themed plane, judged the second-most creative, belongs to Lead Software Engineer and <a href="http://us.movember.com/team/1894881" target="_blank">Movember</a> celebrant Karl Norling:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank artist+author <a href="https://twitter.com/OliverJeffers" target="_blank">Oliver Jeffers</a> for inspiring our contest. While reading Jeffers&rsquo; wonderful children&rsquo;s book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Paper-Caper-Oliver-Jeffers/dp/0399250972/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416013742&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Great+Paper+Caper" target="_blank">The Great Paper Caper</a></em> to his daughters, Chris Hazlett came up with the idea to hold our own paper airplane contest. &ldquo;Three words: Paper Airplane Competition,&rdquo; read the subject line of Chris&rsquo; email to me on October 25, and we were off&ndash;forming a committee and adopting regulations just like any official sporting authority.</p>
<p>We must also thank the people at <a href="http://www.redbullpaperwings.com/" target="_blank">Red Bull, whose &ldquo;Worldwide Paper Plane Contest&rdquo; regulations</a> helped us develop our own contest rules. And one final hat tip goes to Kenny Loggins, whose musical composition set the tone for our racing:</p>
