<p>This week we welcomed Andrew Chen to the Gilt Product Management and UX team. As Director of Product Management, Andrew will work with the Ninjas&ndash;the team responsible for designing the <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/10/17/infiniti-cars-and-fashion-stars-making-adaptive" target="_blank">Infiniti sale</a> and other exciting initiatives&ndash;and will focus on activation and brand excitement.</p>
<p>Andrew joins us from the music streaming service iHeartRadio, where he led product for all mobile and connected device teams. In other prior lives, he spent time leading tech and media industry economic development in NYC under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, started a photo marketplace start-up in Silicon Valley, and was a management consultant.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Andrew loves spending time traveling, working on microfinance and clean water projects in Africa, snowboarding whenever he can, and cooking Oklahoma-style BBQ. We&rsquo;re glad to have him on (snow)board!</p>
