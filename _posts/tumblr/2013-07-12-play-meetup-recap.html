<p>On Wednesday, around 70 Play framework enthusiasts visited Gilt&rsquo;s 2 Park Ave. office in NYC for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/" target="_blank">Play NYC</a> meetup group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Async Coding in Play and Scala&rdquo; talk, featuring LinkedIn engineer Jim Brikman. To add to our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/10/async-coding-in-play-with-both-java-and-scala" target="_blank">earlier post</a> about the meetup: Jim&rsquo;s discussion of Play&rsquo;s non-blocking IO nature.</p>

<ul><li>Seeing identical Play-powered functionality implemented in both Java and Scala highlighted how much more efficient and concise Scala is.</li>
<li>Play and Scala are a great match, especially when it comes to async coding, mostly due to functions being first-class citizens, and having access to great syntax &ldquo;candy&rdquo; such as sequence comprehensions.</li>
<li>If you are stuck in Javaland but want to write more async code and not drown in boilerplate, check out <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/parseq" target="_blank">ParSeq</a>.</li>
</ul><p>Check out the slides from Jim&rsquo;s talk <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brikis98/play-framework-async-io-with-java-and-scala" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
