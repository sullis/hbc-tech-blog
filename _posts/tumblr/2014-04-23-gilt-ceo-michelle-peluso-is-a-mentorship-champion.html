<p>In related: In a <em>New York Times </em>interview published last weekend, Michelle talks about some of her own sources of inspiration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My grandparents had a bunch of different businesses after the war. My dad is an entrepreneur too — he runs an environmental engineering firm. He’s a huge role model for me. He was just authentically passionate about his people. His employees were a big part of our lives. At company picnics, you would be expected, as a kid, to remember the names of the 200 people who worked at his company, as well as their spouses and kids. My mom was a teacher, and she loves the idea of curiosity. She wanted me to love learning.</p>
