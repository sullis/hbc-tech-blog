Natalia is a passionate software engineer and open source contributor who will work on continuous delivery at Gilt. Originally from Poland, she moved to Dublin nearly four years ago and has been getting used to Irish weather ever since. &ldquo;I eventually fell in love with the taste of Guinness and even started to appreciate windy weather and the cold sea, as I recently took kite-surfing lessons,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I also enjoy rock-climbing, skiing and&hellip; shopping. <br/><span>Discovering Gilt brings about both fascinating technological challenges and a fashion thrill :-)&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
