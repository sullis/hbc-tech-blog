Before joining Gilt, Nick spent five years working for a UX design and Development company, specializing in JavaScript applications and front-end development. &ldquo;I do love working with JavaScript,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The whole front-end space has moved at a frantic pace over the last couple of years, and it&rsquo;s been nice riding that wave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his off hours Nick enjoys reading, music, football (fussball could well be a new love), Qi Gong, and spending time with his family. Welcome aboard, Nick!</p>
