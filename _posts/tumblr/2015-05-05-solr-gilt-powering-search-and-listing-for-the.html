<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Apache-Lucene-Solr-Meetup/events/219670219/" target="_blank">Reserve your spot before they’re all gone!</a></p><p>Learn how we adopted Solr at Gilt to provide personalised search results, from early days using Solr 3 on just three nodes, to a more modern clustered deployment today running Solr 4 that powers all listing pages on Gilt through our daily pulse load at noon. We&rsquo;ll discuss what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and where we&rsquo;re going next for search on gilt.com.<br/></p><p>If you haven’t yet heard Ade Trenaman speak, you are in for a treat!  Be there: Thursday, May 14th at 6:30pm!</p>
