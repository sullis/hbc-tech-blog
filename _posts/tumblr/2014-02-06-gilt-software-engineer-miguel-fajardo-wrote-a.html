<p>The things you learn from Facebook about your co-workers: Yesterday some of us Gilt techsters discovered that our colleague, Miguel Angel Fajardo&ndash;a lead software engineer on our back office team&ndash;is a published author! In 2010, Miguel wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Las-aventuras-Sela-Spanish-Edition/dp/0557540097/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank"><em>Las Aventuras de Sela</em></a>, a Spanish-language, illustrated book for kids ages seven to 12. <em>Sela</em> (also available in <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/miguel-fajardo-and-silvia-monge/las-aventuras-de-sela/ebook/product-17370719.html" target="_blank">eBook format</a>) tells the tale of a seal who must relocate after pollution makes her home uninhabitable. On her quest for new digs, she gets lost for a spell but ends up making some new friends. Eventually she finds clean water and a new home.</p>
<p>Miguel derived inspiration for the book during a trip to Dublin (serendipitous <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/dublin" target="_blank">foreshadowing</a>); while walking the city, he spotted some seals sitting on a dock and got the idea for Sela. Writing the book took several months&ndash;Miguel spent his weekends and spare evenings crafting the story. His friend Silvia Monge provided the illustrations.</p>
<p>Miguel says he has considered creating an English-language version of <em>Sela</em>, but needs to find the time. Meanwhile, he&rsquo;s been working on a novel&ndash;it&rsquo;s not about charming aquatic animals, but about human &ldquo;grown-ups.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s looking for an agent, so if you know one ping him <a href="https://twitter.com/toritoandalu" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
