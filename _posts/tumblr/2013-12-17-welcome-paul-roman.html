<p>We&rsquo;re pleased as <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/313320/holiday-citrus-punch?czone=entertaining%2Fholiday-entertaining%2Fholidaycenter-drinks&amp;gallery=275508&amp;slide=313320&amp;center=276958" target="_blank">holiday citrus punch</a> to welcome Paul Roman to Gilt! Based in Blacksburg, Virginia, Paul will work on our <a href="http://www.mmh.com/article/gilt_groupe_no_flash_in_the_distribution_pan" target="_blank">Distribution</a> team.</p>
<p>Before joining Gilt, Paul worked on a real-time, contextual stream-processing PaaS and was responsible for REST, WebSocket, and XMPP API services. Prior to that, he worked on back-end services for a secure, real-time collaboration platform. His favorite technologies at the moment are <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/scala" target="_blank">Scala</a> and Akka for building elastic, distributed systems (which is really convenient for us). He also likes functional programming and is not afraid to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29" target="_blank">the M word</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of technology world, Paul is a yoga warrior, so if you run into him don&rsquo;t be surprised if he talks to you about Ujjayi breath!</p>
