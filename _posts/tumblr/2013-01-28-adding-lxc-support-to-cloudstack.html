<p>At Gilt, our architecture is composed of what we call LOSA&ndash;Lots of Small Applications. These apps currently run on bare metal with a couple dozen application instances per machine. As we move towards a fully automated deployment system, we are looking to replace bare metal with virtualization where each VM has a single application instance. We&rsquo;ve found that Linux containers best meets our needs since it&rsquo;s readily available and has near bare metal performance when running multiple containers. We&rsquo;re likely to end up with thousands of VMs, so we also looked at private cloud solutions that could manage these VMs with a UI interface as well as an API. Cloudstack really stood out for us during our evaluations, however it doesn&rsquo;t yet support LXC&ndash;so we&rsquo;ve decided to move forward with the best fit and add LXC support to Cloudstack.</p>
