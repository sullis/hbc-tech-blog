<p>Members of the Gilt engineering team give lots of technical presentations at <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/01/15/scaling-gilt-at-gilt-nyc-tech-talks-comes-to-2-park" target="_blank">meetups</a>, <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/10/25/gilts-kevin-scaldeferri-on-enabling-micro-service" target="_blank">conferences</a>, our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2011/02/14/the-friday-5-4" target="_blank">in-house</a> gatherings, and <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/12/30/register-for-sauce-labs-next-webinar-automating" target="_blank">online</a>. How do we make sure that our content is &ldquo;tech&rdquo; enough to interest experienced engineers? And how do we confidently tell the most compelling stories possible? With these concerns in mind, I&rsquo;ve created this list of questions to ask while planning and preparing a tech talk. All of you engineers out there in Greater Internetlandia might find it useful as you work on your own presentations:</p>
<ul id="docs-internal-guid-2471b707-08ea-c5bc-9e71-4d89c430c2c3"><li>
<p><span>Which technology/technologies will you discuss in this talk? </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Which technology or aspect of technology will be the </span><em>primary</em><span> focus: a language, a framework, a problem, a methodology, or a combination of technologies working together? (O<em>r &ldquo;other&rdquo;? If &ldquo;other&rdquo; is your answer, please define)</em></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>How would you title and summarize your topic so that, if you saw it advertised on a random events listing page, you would regard it as a “must-attend” talk? <em>(If it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;must-attend&rdquo; yet, keep working!</em>)<br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Will this topic be of obvious interest to engineers? What type of engineers? Please be as precise as possible in describing</span><span> type</span><span> (for example, “experienced generalist engineers who lean front-end,” “front-end mobile UX engineers,” “back-end engineers who work on big data initiatives involving X, Y and Z technologies,” etc.”)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Have you done online research to make sure that no one in the area has given a substantially similar talk in the last 3-6 months? (<em>If someone has already given a similar talk, one option is to take an opposing view; another is to highlight subtopics that the past presenter(s) didn’t discuss</em>)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>From a technical POV, what is the </span><span>most novel/exciting aspect</span><span> of the content you’re providing? And from an implementation POV, what makes your approach remarkable? (<em>In related: What about this topic personally excites and inspires you?</em>)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Does your presentation offer a solution to a commonly held technical problem? What about your proposed solution is novel/different from what you’ve seen discussed in other, similar talks/blog posts/tech lit? (<em>Put another way: Does your presentation offer a way to work better/more efficiently/more creatively?</em>)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The format that would make this talk most compelling would be (choose one): “how-to,” “explainer,” “argument/opinion,” “case study/narrative,&ldquo; &quot;comparison,” &quot;demonstration&rdquo;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Will your talk include a live demo? And what will your samples of code demonstrate or reveal? </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>What notable outside sources&ndash;widely discussed technical articles, others&rsquo; presentations that have gone viral, quotes by well-known technologists&ndash;can your cite in order to place your talk in the broader context of what&rsquo;s currently &ldquo;hot&rdquo; in the engineering community?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span></span><span>What are the resources you need to start and complete your talk: research help? guidance with structure? help creating visuals?</span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li><span>Who else on your team would you like to bring in to provide objective, constructive criticism, brainstorming help, and feedback? (Pick 1-2 members of your team + 1-2 engineers whose work isn’t directly related to your talk’s content)</span></li>
</ul><p><span>Feel free to share your feedback by emailing lapple at gilt dot com. And if you have tips of your own, send them my way&ndash;you&rsquo;ll receive a byline here + a link to your Twitter feed, website or other choice online property that you own.</span></p>
