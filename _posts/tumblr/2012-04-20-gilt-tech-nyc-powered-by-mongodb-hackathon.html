<p>What&rsquo;s better than spending 24 hours in Manhattan hacking on sweet projects using MongoDB and the Gilt API? Doing it while supporting HackNY, a New York City organization that promotes innovation and entrepreneurship among the city&rsquo;s up-and-coming students and hackers. And that&rsquo;s exactly what you can do next weekend, April 27-28, at <a href="http://www.10gen.com/events/NYC-MongoDB-Hackathon" target="_blank">10gen&rsquo;s MongoDB Hackathon</a>. A lot of great people, and great companies, are going to be there, and we&rsquo;re excited to see you come down and make the next cool project. On Saturday night an esteemed panel of judges will choose winning projects and award all manner of prizes, including iPads, Xbox 360s, and more.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be at the event to share how to get started with the Public API and answer any questions you may have, give you ideas on what you could build, and maybe give you a sneak peek into what we&rsquo;re working on for the future of the API, so come find us!</p>

<p>For questions about the event, you can send a tweet to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MongoDB" target="_blank">@MongoDB</a>. For questions about the API, get in touch <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gilttech" target="_blank">@GiltTech</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:api@gilt.com" target="_blank">api@gilt.com</a>!</p>
