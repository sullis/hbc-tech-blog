<p>If you want to see how SQL is applied to big data analytics, we have the perfect holiday present for you: A free, full-day course in advanced SQL and analytics!</p>
<p>Taught by our very own Principal Data Scientist <strong>Igor Elbert</strong>, this eight-hour course will show you how SQL is applied in the big data field. You&rsquo;ll also come away with a better understanding of what MapReduce is, and learn how to analyze click-stream data.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>When: </strong>Wednesday, Dec. 18 from 10:30 AM-6:30 PM<br/><strong>Where:</strong> Gilt, 2 Park Ave. in Manhattan, NYC<br/><strong>What you need to bring: </strong>Your laptop, your brain, and one or two Capri Suns to drink with your lunch&ndash;which we will provide&ndash;for FREE (you&rsquo;ll also get a free breakfast)</p>
<p><strong>What Can I Expect?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the agenda (subject to change):</p>
<ol><li>Quick SQL Refresher (with lab)</li>
<li>Anatomy of MPP database</li>
<li>Pros and cons of procedural and descriptive languages</li>
<li>Map/Reduce</li>
<li>SQL+Map-Reduce = SQL/MR (with lab)</li>
<li>SQL/MR use cases (click-stream analysis, calling domain-parsing APIs from SQL, etc)</li>
</ol><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course?</strong></p>
<p>This class is perfect for you if you&rsquo;re:</p>
<ul><li>A data analyst who wants to get into big data or data science</li>
<li>A recent grad from one of the quantitative disciplines</li>
<li>a data enthusiast who has taught yourself SQL</li>
</ul><p>A strong understanding of SELECT is expected. Fluency with JOINs, GROUP, ORDER, DISTINCT, HAVING, and COUNT is a must.</p>
<p><strong>Besides the Free SQL Knowledge I&rsquo;ll Acquire From Gilt&rsquo;s Handsome and Brilliant Principal Data Scientist, What Else Do I Get?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, <strong><em>maybe a job at Gilt</em></strong>? It&rsquo;s true(!): We&rsquo;re looking for a data analyst/consultant for a three-month gig starting ASAP, with the possibility of another three-month extension. You&rsquo;ll munge our data from our NYC office (it&rsquo;s quite posh and there&rsquo;s ample amounts of chocolate candy hanging about&ndash;live a little!) and get to work alongside our data engineering team. This position will provide some exposure to machine learning, Teradata Aster and SQL/MapReduce on a massively parallel platform. A desire to understand the business side of things will come in handy. </p>
<p><strong>This sounds amazing. How can I prove to you that I am worthy?</strong></p>
