<p>New to Scala? Working on a Scala project and need some guidance? Curious about the Typesafe platform, and interested in exploring it? Then grab your laptop and head on over to our 2 Park Ave. office in Manhattan on Wednesday, August 7 for our first-ever <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Hacker-Hours/" target="_blank">Scala Hacker Hours NYC</a> meetup. The meetup begins at 6:30 PM and ends at 8:30 PM; light refreshments will be provided.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;hacker hours,&rdquo; you ask? In his brand-new, open-source <a href="https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/wiki/DIY-Guide" target="_blank">Hacker Hours DIY Guide</a>, NYC developer and experienced hacker-hour host Aidan Feldman describes them as &ldquo;free office hours for programming help; open to anyone, regardless of age or skill level; not a class, and not a lecture.&rdquo; For our kick-off Scala session, several Gilt engineers will be available to answer your Scala-centric questions and point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t make it on August 7, fret not: We&rsquo;ll be hosting Scala Hacker Hours every other week. Join <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Hacker-Hours/" target="_blank">the meetup group</a> to make sure you receive our announcements. Hope to see you on August 7!</p>
