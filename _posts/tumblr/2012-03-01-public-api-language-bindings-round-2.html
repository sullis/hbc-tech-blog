<p>There&rsquo;s been even more work done getting the Gilt API wrapped up in language bindings over the past two weeks and I&rsquo;m here to present the newest to you in case any of them tickle your fancy.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/nopolabs/gilt_api_php" target="_blank">gilt_api_php</a></em> is a PHP client written by Gilt Tech member <a href="https://github.com/nopolabs" target="_blank">Dan Revel</a>. This library has tests and a demo app to get you started on downloading and featuring sales and products in no time.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/nitindhar7/gilt-java" target="_blank">Gilt-Java</a></em>, by Gilt Tech&rsquo;s very own <a href="https://github.com/nitindhar7" target="_blank">Nitin Dhar</a>, is of course a Java library for the Public API. Nitin is working on some Android compatibility so mobile app developers don&rsquo;t need to remain glued to our iOS bindings!</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/aellerton/gilt-python" target="_blank">gilt-python</a></em> is a brand new Python library brewed here at Gilt by engineer <a href="https://github.com/aellerton" target="_blank">Andrew Ellerton</a>. If you&rsquo;re working in Python, give it a try and see how you like it!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re hard at work on compiling a permanent directory of client libraries like the ones we&rsquo;ve featured on this blog and some of the applications people have built already. <a href="mailto:api@gilt.com" target="_blank">Email us</a> soon if you have something you want to see included!</p>
