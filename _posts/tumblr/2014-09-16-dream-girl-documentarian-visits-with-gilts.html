<p>Last week the <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/women+in+tech" target="_blank">women of #gilttech</a> invited New York City-based documentary filmmaker <a href="https://twitter.com/erinebagwell" target="_blank">Erin Bagwell</a> (center) over to Gilt&rsquo;s Manhattan office for snacks, bevs and an informal chat. Erin&rsquo;s latest project is <em>Dream, Girl</em>: a documentary that tells the stories of women entrepreneurs. Watch a clip right here:</p>

<p>Erin just <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreamgirl/dream-girl-the-documentary" target="_blank">raised more than $100,000</a> to finish <em>Dream, Girl</em>. That&rsquo;s nearly twice as much as she&rsquo;d originally sought&ndash;a fact that indicates the strong interest in her project. And she&rsquo;s alread received a lot of press coverage from the likes of <em>Bust</em>, <em>Elle</em> and <em>The Daily Beast</em>. The Gilt Tech women were excited to hear more about the inspiration behind the documentary and Erin&rsquo;s plans for its completion. Thanks to Erin for visiting us!</p>
