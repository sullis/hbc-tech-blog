<p>We&rsquo;re definitely getting this week off to an unforgettable start!: Here&rsquo;s Scala creator and Typesafe Chairman Dr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky" target="_blank">Martin Odersky</a> with the Gilt tech team earlier today. Dr. Odersky spent an hour answering our questions about Scala, Java 8, and much more. Later tonight he returns to 2 Park to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Gilt-Tech-Events/events/181960522/" target="_blank">give a talk</a> on &ldquo;Scala&ndash;The Simple Parts.&rdquo; Many thanks to Dr. Odersky for his generosity, and to Typesafe for helping us to organize today&rsquo;s lunch and presentation!</p>
