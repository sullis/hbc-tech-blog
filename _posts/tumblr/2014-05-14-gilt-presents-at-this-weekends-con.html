<p>A few months ago the #gilttech team was excited to learn about <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/" target="_blank">!!Con</a>: a brand-new, two-day tech conference focused on what&rsquo;s exciting about programming. Now we&rsquo;re even more excited to announce that one of our own, Gilt City Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/jennifer+shin" target="_blank">Jennifer Shin</a>, is presenting! With &ldquo;High Schoolers vs. Robots!!!!,&rdquo; Jennifer will focus on what she learned during our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/03/bronx-academy-of-software-engineering-students-visited" target="_blank">recent visit with students from the Bronx Academy for Software Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Jennifer presents her 10-minute talk on Saturday at 1:45 PM; the full conference <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/speakers.html#mbernstein" target="_blank">speaker roster</a> schedule is here.</p>
