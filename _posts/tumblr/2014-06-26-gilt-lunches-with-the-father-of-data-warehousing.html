<p>Recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Inmon" target="_blank">Bill Inmon</a>, known to many a data scientist as &ldquo;the father of data warehousing,&rdquo; stopped by the Gilt office in NYC&ndash;very cool! Mr. Inmon was in town as the featured speaker of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dmforum.org/portal/" target="_blank">BIG DATA and Enterprise Architecture 2014</a>,&rdquo; hosted by the Data Management Forum, and swung by 2 Park for some vegetarian food and photo-taking. &ldquo;H<span>e wasn&rsquo;t shy about his feelings on some of the software we work with,&rdquo; says one Data team member, who adds that Mr. Inmon also has a great sense of humor. We hope he visits us again!<br/></span></p>
