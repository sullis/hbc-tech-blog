<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 1, Gilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer presented &ldquo;The Art of Personalization in a Flash Sale Business,&rdquo; an overview of the strategies Gilt uses to attract, interact with, and persuade customers to make quick decisions on high-end purchases. Erik&rsquo;s talk was part of &ldquo;Built to Scale,&rdquo; a <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/09/04/ny-tech-council-presents-three-part-series-featuring" target="_blank">three-part speaker series</a> featuring Gilt leaders and organized by the NY Tech Council.

<p>Erik discussed what we call &ldquo;smart serendipity&rdquo;: the discovery of surprising, albeit personally relevant items. He also explained how Gilt implements this strategy on our platform, both at the end-user interface and predictive affinity engine levels, to personalize shopping experiences for millions of users.<br/><br/> Erik joined Gilt in November 2012, after founding and serving as Executive Chairman of Cascaad&ndash;the company behind the innovative interest-based social network CircleMe. In 2005, Erik co-founded and was CEO of the Internet TV pioneer Babelgum. Earlier in his career, he spent nearly a decade doing advanced research in Internet mathematics, machine learning and computational vision as a research professor at University College London, at the Neurosciences Institute (San Diego), at Xerox Parc (Palo Alto) and at Stanford University, where he received his PhD. Erik has also served as a board director and adviser to a number of early-stage tech companies.</p>
