<p>Tomorrow (Thu 10/10) marks the opening of <a href="http://www.moma.org/learn/kids_families/labs#current" target="_blank"><em>MoMA Art Lab: Movement</em></a>, a new exhibition at New York City&rsquo;s Museum of Modern Art&ndash;and Gilt mobile engineer Ruxy Staicut is one of the featured artists. Ruxy&rsquo;s piece, titled &ldquo; Dra'wii'ng Jackson Pollock,&rdquo; is an interactive installation that invites people create art pieces inspired by the painting styles of Jackson Pollock and other artists by using technology on projected canvases.<br/><br/>Ruxy first worked on the installation&ndash;a collaboration with UX/UI designer <a href="http://www.siontheweb.net/SI-HEUN-CHO" target="_blank">Si Heun Cho</a>&ndash;during her first semester as a graduate student in NYU/Tisch School of the Art&rsquo;s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), which combines art and technology. The main idea of the piece, which was originally inspired by a documentary about Jackson Pollock, is to use existing technology to create digital art pieces with similar movements the artist used. Recently the MoMA discovered Ruxy&rsquo;s work online and, with the Art Lab&rsquo;s Movement theme in mind, invited her to exhibit. The project has been further expanded from Jackson Pollock to use the same technology and movement for other artist styles.<br/><br/>MoMA&rsquo;s Art Lab program offers kids and adults opportunities to explore and create art, discuss their ideas and interact with the work of other creators. Movement runs through August 31, 2014, so you&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to catch it!</p>
