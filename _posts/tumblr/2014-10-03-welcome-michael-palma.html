<p>Gilt is super-excited to welcome Michael Palma to our software engineering team! Formerly known as &ldquo;The Intern&rdquo;&ndash;he spent fall/winter 2013 with us through the University of Waterloo co-op program&ndash;Michael is now known around the office as &ldquo;The Employee.&rdquo; Here is what he has to say about himself:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a recent Computer Engineering graduate, originally from Toronto. I am extremely passionate about my job here at Gilt and have fallen in love with the beautiful city of New York. I am a big fan of cooking, video games, and&ndash;of course&ndash;grabbing drinks with a few friends. I really am looking forward to the challenges I face as a Software Engineer at Gilt!</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Glad to have you back, Employee!</div>
