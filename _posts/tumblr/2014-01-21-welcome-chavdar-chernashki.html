<p>We&rsquo;re happy to have Chavdar Chernashki join our team in Dublin! Before joining Gilt, Chavdar worked on a highly scalable notification system based on WebSockets, REST and InfiniSpan. Prior to that he worked at AOL on a<span> real-time bidding technology platform for advertisers. His favorite technologies at the moment are </span><span>Scala, Closure and Groovy. When it comes to developing software, simplicity is what he strives for and appreciates. <br/><br/></span> <span>Outside of work, Chavdar stays busy teaching his son &ldquo;honesty and truthfulness.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s grateful for his wife, who &ldquo;loves and listens. :)&rdquo;<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome, Chavdar!</span></p>
