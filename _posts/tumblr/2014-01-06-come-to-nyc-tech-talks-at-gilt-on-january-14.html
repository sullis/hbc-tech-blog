<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Tech-Talks/" target="_blank">NYC Tech Talks</a> is one of New York City&rsquo;s top meetup groups for technologists who write and test code or work with servers, so we&rsquo;re very excited to be hosting their next meetup on Tuesday, Jan. 14. Even more exciting for us is that our very own Yoni Goldberg will be the featured presenter!</p>
<p>A lead software engineer on our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/12/19/some-of-the-gilt-personalization-teams-favorite" target="_blank">Personalization team</a>, Yoni <span>will describe the evolution of Gilt’s technology stack and provide a deep dive into some of the lessons we&rsquo;ve learned along the way. He’ll also highlight some of the core challenges that a tech team needs to consider and address before heading down the path of building a first-class micro-services architecture. </span></p>
<p>Please join us next Tuesday for pizza, beer, and a great talk by Yoni! <span>Learn about how we&rsquo;ve transformed our infrastructure from a monolithic Ruby application into distributed, fault tolerant, scalable architecture based on hundreds of micro-services built with Scala. And find out how we&rsquo;ve implemented the concepts of immutability and idempotence throughout our service layer and architecture.</span></p>
