<p>If performance issues are making you feel like King Kong&ndash;i.e., disgruntled and prone to going on a rampage&ndash;then head on over to the Empire State Building next Wednesday and get some relief. Gilt Lead Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/gregory+mazurek" target="_blank">Gregory Mazurek</a> will appear at the next New York Front End Coders meetup to explain how Gilt analyzes web performance <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/11/11/a-synthetic-monitoring-case-study" target="_blank">using RUM and synthetic monitoring</a> as well as the W3C Performance Timing API. He&rsquo;ll give a couple examples of recent performance issues at Gilt and how our tech team has integrated performance into our workflow. By the end, you should feel rather enlightened and calm&ndash;more like Curious George than a monster gorilla.</p>
<p>Also on the bill will be Nathaniel Lee, who will discuss &ldquo;Leveraging Functional Programming in JS.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyfrontendcoders/events/219879238/" target="_blank">Go here</a> to RSVP (and do it before Monday, January 26).</p>
