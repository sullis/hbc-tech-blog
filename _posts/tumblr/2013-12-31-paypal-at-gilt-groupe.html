Exciting, because we knew that many of our members sought the option to make purchases with PayPal.</p>
<p>A few months ago we rolled out PayPal support on Gilt.com, GiltCity.com, and in Gilt’s iPhone application. Our implementation uses <em>PayPal Express Checkout</em> to establish a billing agreement between Gilt and the end user. The presentation above <strong>(click the pic)</strong> &ndash; a new revision of a talk I gave at the <a href="http://www.cdjdn.com/content/implementing-paypal-gilt-groupe" target="_blank">Capital District Java Developers Network</a>&rsquo;s October meetup &ndash; provides a quick overview of how PayPal works on our various platforms, and some of the engineering decisions we made to make it all happen.</p>
