<p>Please welcome Kevin Schultz, the newest member of Gilt&rsquo;s mobile team! <span class="il">Kevin</span> will focus on Android and will push our update to release.</p>
<p>In a past life Kevin worked with fellow Gilt Senior Software Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/matt+isaacs" target="_blank">Matt Isaacs</a> (Mobile) and Lead Software Engineer Brian Ballantine (Personalization), which suggests that some sort of colonization is taking place (no complaints&ndash;they&rsquo;re all amazing!). He&rsquo;s also been a mechanical engineer and worked on nuclear submarines, but he can&rsquo;t tell you about it or else he will have to kill you. He also enjoys sailing, surfing, and snowboarding. Most importantly he likes Android. Here he is at Monday&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/05/21/dr-martin-odersky-at-gilt-5-19-2014-video-photos" target="_blank">Scalapalooza</a>, contemplating a table decked out with dozens of Num Pang sandwiches.<br/><br/> Welcome, Kevin! <em>(Photo by <a href="http://nancyborowick.com/" target="_blank">Nancy Borowick</a>)</em></p>
