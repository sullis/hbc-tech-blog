<p>The popular Dublin-based tech website Silicon Republic recently published &ldquo;The Five Minute CIO,&rdquo; a short interview with Gilt VP Architecture <strong>Eric Bowman</strong>. A fun excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On a good day, I manage to get a few hours of coding in, and this job has made me into more of a morning person than I ever thought possible. Recently we&rsquo;ve done a lot of hiring, so I end up spending less time coding and doing architecture than I would like, though when I&rsquo;m lucky some architecture work happens while I sleep.</p>
