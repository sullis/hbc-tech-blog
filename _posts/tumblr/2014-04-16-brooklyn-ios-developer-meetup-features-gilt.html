<p>Tonight Matt Isaacs represents Gilt at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Brooklyn-iPhone-and-iPad-Developer-Meetup/events/165785682/?_af_eid=165785682&amp;_af=event&amp;a=uc1_te" target="_blank">Brooklyn iOS Developer meetup&rsquo;s monthly event</a>! Matt, a Senior Software Engineer on our mobile team, will discuss how we&rsquo;ve streamlined testing by adopting Sauce Labs’ Appium and other automated tools. He’ll also talk about some of the technical and cultural pain points related to mobile testing, and discuss Gilt’s approach to mitigating these issues. Speakers from CBS Sports, FiftyThree and Small Planet will also present at tonight&rsquo;s sold-out meetup, which begins at 7 PM at Huge in DUMBO.</p>
