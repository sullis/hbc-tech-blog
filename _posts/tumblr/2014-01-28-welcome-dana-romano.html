<p><span class="il">We&rsquo;re pleased to welcome Dana</span> <span class="il">Romano</span> to Gilt&rsquo;s program management office! She brings the art of program management to the Gilt data team (aka &ldquo;the Data Pandas&rdquo;)!<br/><br/><span class="il">In addition to program management, Dana has held positions in</span> sales and recruiting. Most recently, <span class="il">she</span> spent three years overseeing enterprise software development for the customer care organization of one of America&rsquo;s largest companies. In her spare time she snowboards, rides horses, and spends as much time outdoors as possible. Her passion is animals and she is an active volunteer for several dog rescues in the Tri-State area (here she is on a rescue mission with FlyPups, a nonprofit that transports dogs from high-kill shelters to rescue organizations). She has two dogs and a horse of her own.</p>
<p>Welcome, Dana!</p>
