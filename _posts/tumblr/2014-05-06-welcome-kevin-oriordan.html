<p>Gilt is excited to welcome Kevin O'Riordan to our tech team! Based in Dublin, Kevin is a software engineer and joins our push team. Before arriving at Gilt, he spent more than three years developing software (more specifically, behavioral targeting software) to support online advertising campaigns. A native of Cork, he studied at University College Cork.</p>
<p>In his free time, Kevin enjoys hill running, mountain biking, adventure racing and skiing. We&rsquo;re glad to have him on board!</p>
