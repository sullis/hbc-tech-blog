<p>Today Gilt Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert is appearing at the <a href="https://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/big-data-innovation-boston/schedule" target="_blank">Big Data Innovation Summit</a> (&ldquo;the largest gathering of Fortune 500 business executives leading Big Data initiatives&rdquo;) in Boston to give a presentation on visualizing the wisdom of the crowd. Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Calculating co-purchase affinities between product categories, brands, and price groups requires analysis of all the transactions collected by the company. Working with affinities based on co-view requires looking into every click. It’s a big data undertaking, but after all the number crunching is done, how to present information to a business user in a meaningful way? We will showcase some approaches Gilt’s data team uses to visualize and navigate information gleaned from the ‘wisdom of the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big Data Innovation isn&rsquo;t Igor&rsquo;s only conference appearance this week. Tomorrow afternoon he&rsquo;ll be at the New York Academy of Medicine for the annual DataGotham conference: a full day of networking, talks, and other activities for the NYC/metro-area data science community. Igor will join representatives from Harvard, Yale, Goldman Sachs, and other prestigious places you&rsquo;ve heard of in giving a short talk. Igor&rsquo;s presentation starts at 12:50 PM; you can find the full schedule <a href="http://www.datagotham.com/schedule/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
