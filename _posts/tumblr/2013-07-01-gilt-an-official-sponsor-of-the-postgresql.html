<p>Gilt has officially become a Silver Sponsor of this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://2013.pgconf.eu/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL Conference Europe</a>, which will take place October 29 through November 1 in Dublin, Ireland (where we have an office). PGConf.EU, as it&rsquo;s otherwise known, is the largest PostgreSQL conference in Europe and involves most of Europe&rsquo;s user groups. In addition to talks in English, German, Dutch and other languages, the conference will include a full day of short PostgreSQL training sessions. <a href="http://2013.pgconf.eu/registration/" target="_blank">Registration</a> for the conference hasn&rsquo;t begun yet, but if you&rsquo;re interested in presenting, you&rsquo;re in luck: the deadline for talk proposals runs through July 22, 2013.</p>
