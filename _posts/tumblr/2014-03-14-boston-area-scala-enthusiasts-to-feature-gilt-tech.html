Yoni will discuss our distributed Scala micro-services architecture, and describe some of the technological innovations that have helped Gilt to reach its current size. He&rsquo;ll also highlight some of the core challenges that the company&rsquo;s engineering team continues to face, and address what every tech team needs to consider  before heading down the path of building a first-class micro-services architecture. Pizza and beer provided. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/boston-scala/events/170272742/" target="_blank">RSVP here!</a></p>
