<p>Earlier today, <span>Apple&rsquo;s Craig Federighi</span> presented a demo of Safari&rsquo;s new push notification system that featured the implementation we put together at <a href="http://www.gilt.com/sale/women" target="_blank">www.gilt.com/sale/women</a>. You can watch the special event online <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2013/" target="_blank">here</a> (catch the Gilt references at the 18:30 mark), or you can glance at the screenshots below.</p>
<p><span>The <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/22/websites-activating-safari-push-notifications-ahead-of-os-x-mavericks-rollout" target="_blank">Mavericks operating system</a> will allow us to send members push notifications to their desktops/laptops on Safari. Like our iPhone/iPad push notifications, this is a great way for us to communicate time-sensitive information to our members about the moment sales start and wait list item availability. And with the iCloud Keychain functionality, members&rsquo; usernames, passwords and credit card info will be synched up across their devices and stored securely in iCloud for even faster and easier check-out than before.</span></p>
<p>When you navigate to <a href="http://www.gilt.com/sale/women" target="_blank">www.gilt.com/sale/women</a> on Safari Mavericks, you will see a prompt at the top of the page that asks you if you&rsquo;d like to turn on push messaging:</p>

<p>After you subscribe, you&rsquo;ll receive messages from Gilt whenever we have something urgent to tell you. This is what Craig saw during his demo:</p>

<p>If you click on the message, you will be taken to the relevant Gilt page:</p>

<p>And once you decide to buy that tent, Mavericks will sync your login information across all of your devices:</p>

<p>And when you get to the checkout screen, Mavericks will also help you manage your credit card information:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank Apple for featuring Gilt during its demo, and all of the Gilt team members who helped get this ready for Apple&rsquo;s presentation. Although it&rsquo;s only been a few hours since the launch of this new feature, quite a few people have already signed up. And because Mavericks is now free (!), why not download it and sign up for our desktop push notifications!?</p>
