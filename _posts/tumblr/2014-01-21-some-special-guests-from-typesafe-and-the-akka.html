<p>Last Thursday Gilt had the pleasure of hosting Typesafe Developer Advocate <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/10/01/a-quick-catch-up-with-james-ward-of-typesafe" target="_blank">James Ward</a> and Director of Sales Tim Kirk, Akka Team member Henrik Engström, and a small group of NYC-based Typesafe platform enthusiasts for dinner at our 2 Park Ave. office. Over beer and Turkish food, about 27 of us spent a few hours talking about Typesafe&rsquo;s efforts to educate people on how to program in Scala, the future of Play Framework, object-relational mapping, and much more. Thanks to all of our guests for attending!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to invite Henrik back to Gilt this Thursday to work from our office and hang out. More on that to come!</p>
