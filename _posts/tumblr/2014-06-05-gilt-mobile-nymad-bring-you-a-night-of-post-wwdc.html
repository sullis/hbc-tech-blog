<p>Fresh off their <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/28/we-won-the-webby" target="_blank">Webby Award</a> win for best iPhone app (shopping), the Gilt Mobile team is partnering up with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/168007732/" target="_blank">our friends</a> at the New York Mobile App Developer meetup group for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/180107822/" target="_blank">What Would Developers Code?: A Night of Post-WWDC Lightning Talks and Hacking</a>. From 5:30 to 9 PM, all of you mobile developers out there are invited to join Gilt and NYMAD for some fun hacking on new tools unveiled by Apple at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/" target="_blank">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>, which wraps up tomorrow in San Francisco. We&rsquo;ll also have short (five- to ten-minute talks) by WWDC attendees, delicious foods that aren&rsquo;t pizza, and cold beverages! <strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/events/180107822/" target="_blank">To RSVP, just go here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Talks will take place on the hour (5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and 8:30 PM), but feel free to come and go for as long as you wish. If you are going to WWDC, come and share your experiences! If you aren’t attending WWDC, this meetup will be an informative and fun recap.</p>
