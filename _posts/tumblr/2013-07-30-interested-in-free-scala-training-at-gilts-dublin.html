<p>Live in Dublin, or plan to hang out there later this summer? Tired of Java, and intrigued by this sleek and elegant Scala language you keep hearing about? Excited about learning languages for free? Then fill out the form below to express your interest in our upcoming free Scala course! Taught by some of Gilt Tech&rsquo;s resident Scalasmiths, this <strong>one-day, beginners-level</strong> class will take place <strong>Fri 8/30</strong> and again on <strong>Fri 9/13</strong> in our Dublin office. Our class will cover fundamentals such as:</p>
<ul><li>Classes, traits and objects</li>
<li>Tuples and case classes</li>
<li>Monads</li>
<li>More!</li>
</ul><p>The training day will last from 9 AM to 5 PM with a working lunch. Developers of all programming languages&ndash;but especially Java&ndash;are invited to participate. Just fill out the form below to submit your contact info, and we&rsquo;ll let you know if you&rsquo;ve been selected. <br/><br/>Submitting this form <strong>does not guarantee you a seat</strong>. However, it does mean that you’ll receive details about the other courses we’re developing—including advanced Scala and Play—as soon as they become available.</p>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION FOR THESE SESSIONS IS CLOSED</strong></p>
