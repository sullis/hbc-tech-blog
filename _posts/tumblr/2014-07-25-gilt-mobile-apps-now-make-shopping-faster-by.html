<p><span>Gilt’s iPhone and iPad apps now allow our customers to quickly re-apply the size filters they have previously used. To filter a sale by your sizes, simply tap on the “Refine by Your Sizes” button. If you haven’t previously filtered by size on our apps, use the “Refine” feature to do so and the next time you visit a sale you’ll be able to use this quick shortcut.</span></p>
