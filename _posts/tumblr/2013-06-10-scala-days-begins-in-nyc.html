<p>Greetings from the <a href="http://scaladays.org/" target="_blank">Scala Days</a> conference! Here&rsquo;s a pic of Gilt Techies Mark Wunsch (NYC office, yellow shirt) and Eric Bowman (Dublin office, button-down) repping at our official booth, where we&rsquo;re giving out stickers, pens, info sheets, and official conference swag bags.</p>
<p>Gilt is a platinum sponsor of this year&rsquo;s conference, taking place now through June 12 at the historic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Theatre" target="_blank">Hudson Theatre</a> in NYC. Scala Days 2013 features a lunchtime presentation by Eric (Tuesday, 1PM) and two full days of talks by <a href="http://typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a> leaders and Scala enthusiasts from around the globe. If you&rsquo;re attending the conference, stop by our booth and say hello! We&rsquo;ve brought an iPad so you can check out our <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/gilt_groupe" target="_blank">Gilt API lessons at Codecademy</a> and are happy to answer any questions you might have about how we&rsquo;re using Scala, Play and Akka.</p>
