<p>They say that knowledge is power. Nothing could be truer when it comes to the world of business. Customer analytics insights can pack a powerful punch when it comes to your marketing efforts by creating a personal connection. If you know what your customers want, you can give it to them. If you give your customers what they want, they feel a personal connection with you. And that personal connection brings them back to you, time and again. Tune in as Tamara Gruzbarg, Senior Director of Analytics and Research at Gilt Groupe, joins Brent Leary for an in-depth discussion on this concept.</p>

<p>Small Business Trends: Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your background?</p>
<p>Tamara Gruzbarg: I have been working in the area of data analytics for over 15 years. I started my career in financial services, big banks, credit cards, and retail banking.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know Gilt.com, we are just five years old. We are one of the pioneers in the Flash Sales Space online in the U.S. and we have new sales starting every day at noon. We have a limited inventory of sought after brands in women’s and men’s apparel, home goods, kid’s stuff, gourmet foods, etc.</p>
<p>My role at Gilt is to lead the customer analytics and research team to figure out how can we get so personal with customers that they will say:</p>
<p>“I shop at Gilt because Gilt gets me!”</p>
