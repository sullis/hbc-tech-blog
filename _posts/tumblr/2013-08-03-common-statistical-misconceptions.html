<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Correlation doesn&rsquo;t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing &lsquo;look over there.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/></strong></em></p>
<p>I was intrigued by this gem of statistical poetry, which Lifehacker writer Eric Ravenscraft quotes in his great new article, &ldquo;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/imo-the-number-one-statistical-fallacy-and-one-you-do-917154313" target="_blank">Four Common Statistical Misconceptions You Should Avoid</a>.&rdquo; I had not heard the quote before. (Eric attributes it to a well-known <a href="http://xkcd.com/552/" title="xkcd Correlation strip" target="_blank">xkcd correlation strip</a>, but it&rsquo;s not in the picture: mouse over an image, and the wisdom will reveal itself.)</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s article made me think about other common fallacies to add to his list&ndash;including one that I call &ldquo;<strong>misdirected statistical rigor</strong>.&rdquo; It strikes when misunderstood, dirty and/or poorly collected data is run through the paces of statistical analysis and then either misinterpreted or not interpreted at all. A couple of jokes to illustrate:</p>
<ul><li>Statistical analysis of Internet adoption in rural areas has shown a very high level of Internet usage. The data was collected via web survey (aka self-selection bias).</li>
<li>From an unknown (at least to me) author: &ldquo;According to the Institute of Incomplete Research, 9 out of 10&hellip;&rdquo; Replace &ldquo;9 out of 10&rdquo; with &ldquo;f-value is decent,&rdquo; or &ldquo;kappa is looking good today,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll realize that the Institute of Incomplete Research has a huge alumni base.</li>
</ul><p>What are your favorite statistical (or analytical) misconceptions? Or anti-patterns, if you are into that kind of thing?</p>
