<p>To build a truly great, inspiring tech organization, you need to trust your team to make decisions and manage projects directly. That was the takeaway of “<strong>Trust: The Secret to Scaling a Tech Organization</strong>,” the presentation Gilt co-founder and CTO Michael Bryzek gave yesterday at the <a href="http://surge.omniti.com/2013/" target="_blank">Surge</a> conference in National Harbor, MD.</p>
<p>By focusing on execution and empowerment, Gilt has grown its team from zero to 1,000 employees in just a few years. In the process, we’ve cultivated a culture that emphasizes trusting people to follow the right course of action. This means that anyone can post to the tech blog, throw a party (as long as there’s money left in the budget!), and experiment with cutting-edge technologies that aren’t currently part of our stack. To keep projects and innovation moving forward, we use key performance indicators that measure our progress. <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mbryzek/trust-the-secret-to-scaling-a-tech-organization" target="_blank"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to view slides from the talk.</p>
<p>Surge, organized by OmniTI, is one of the top scalability and performance conferences in the world. This year&rsquo;s Surge featured some excellent companies&ndash;including Spotify, Box, Fastly and AppNexus&ndash;as well as a variety of promising start-ups and enterprises. Among the many highlights was Message Systems CTO Alec Peterson’s presentation on &ldquo;Messaging at Scale.” Peterson described his company’s messaging ecosystem and how they built a massively parallel, event-driven system to manage two-way communication around email. Much of what he talked about lined up with the design of our own push notification system (apn), which was some nice validation for us.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight of all, however, was getting to Surge’s engaged, knowledgeable audience. During the post-presentation Q&amp;A, audience members asked Bryzek lots of questions about the mechanics of KPIs, the organizational transition to our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/03/07/scaling-agile-at-gilt-with-teams-ingredients" target="_blank">current team structure</a>, our peer-to-peer budgeting experiment, <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/01/talking-tact-stacks-and-antifragility-at-tech-in" target="_blank">anti-fragility</a>, and other topics. Their enthusiasm and interest in what we do at Gilt was energizing and inspiring. Thanks again to OmniTI and its partners for inviting us to participate!</p>
