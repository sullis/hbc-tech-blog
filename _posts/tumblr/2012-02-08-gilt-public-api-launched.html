<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to tell you that we&rsquo;ve launched our Public API today, providing programmatic access to a constantly-updating collection of flash sales full of the usual kind of awesome stuff we offer on Gilt&rsquo;s stores.</p>

<p>We held an internal hackathon two weeks ago and saw some really interesting projects come out of just a day&rsquo;s work and the brainpower of one room of (admittedly super-smart and obviously very handsome) Gilt engineers, but I can only imagine where things can go now that we&rsquo;ve got the whole developer community armed and ready.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not like me and don&rsquo;t just get pumped up whenever you see a new API you can <code>curl</code>, maybe I can sweeten the deal a bit— we&rsquo;re in the process of putting the finishing touches on an affiliate marketing program, meaning that you can earn a cut of any money we make when your app leads to a purchase on Gilt. You can start building your project now and we&rsquo;ll have the details on how to sign up and integrate this into your work soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://dev.gilt.com" target="_blank">Gilt Developer Portal</a> is your go-to site to read up on how to use our API and apply for API keys for your applications. We&rsquo;ll be adding more information to that site regularly as we add new features and content to the Public API. Exposing sales and products is just a first step; we&rsquo;ve got a lot of exciting ideas in the works, so stay tuned!</p>
