<p><span>If you’re from Silicon Alley, you likely associate the name “Bryzek” with <span><a href="http://tech.gilt.com/tagged/michael-bryzek" target="_blank"><span><strong>Michael Bryzek</strong></span></a></span>: co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://gilt.com/" target="_blank"><span>Gilt</span></a>, the innovative eCommerce company founded in 2007. A graduate of MIT, Michael is also the former CTO of United eWay and co-founded Volunteer Solutions, an Internet-application service provider for the philanthropic sector acquired by the United Way in 2001. </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re from Silicon Valley, you might be more familiar with the work of Michael’s father, <strong><span><a href="http://www.semiconwest.org/node/11086" target="_blank"><span>Janusz Bryzek</span></a></span></strong>. Widely known as the “Father of Sensors,” Dr. Bryzek has founded seven high-tech start-ups in the MEMS field, won Lifetime Achievement awards from the likes of MANCEF and <em>Sensors Magazine</em>, authored hundreds of  papers, and patented dozens of ideas. Dr. Bryzek’s most recent accomplishments include starting a company that develops inertial sensors for mobile applications (sold to Fairchild Semiconductor in 2011) and conceiving, organizing and chairing the <span><a href="http://www.tsensorssummit.org" target="_blank"><span>TSensors Summit</span></a></span> at Stanford University in October 2013. The latter event was triggered by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Future-Better-Than-Think/dp/1451614217/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383700055&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=abundance" target="_blank"><em>Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think</em></a>, the best-selling book forecasting the elimination of major global problems such as hunger, lack of medical care, clean water and energy in just one generation through eight exponential technologies&ndash;sensors being one of them.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>On <strong>Tuesday, November 26</strong>, you can meet and learn from both Bryzeks at this “Internet of Things”-related tech talk hosted at Gilt. As the featured speaker, Dr. Bryzek will discuss his latest project&ndash;“<strong>Roadmap for the Trillion Sensor Universe</strong>”&ndash;and share insights gained from his 30-plus years of experience as a pioneer in the sensor industry. His talk will touch upon the huge market opportunities that sensors present, and will highlight the potential role of sensors in Wearables, eHealth, HP Labs&rsquo; Central Nervous System for the Earth project, the Internet of Things, and Context Computing. Many of these cutting-edge technologies focus on <span>dramatically improving human life, </span>augmenting reality and supporting the quantified self.</span></p>
<p><span>In honor of the approaching Thanksgiving holiday, we’ll forgo the standard tech meetup pizza and beer in favor of more festive pumpkin pie and warm drinks. And in the spirit of giving thanks, we&rsquo;re also using this event as an opportunity to collect food for <strong><a href="http://www.cityharvest.org/" target="_blank">City Harvest</a></strong>. T<span>he world’s first food rescue organization, City Harvest helps feed more than one million New Yorkers every year.</span> <em><strong>Most needed items include: canned fruit, canned vegetables, peanut butter (plastic jars), macaroni and cheese (packaged), hot and cold cereal (packaged, family-sized). Note: City Harvest cannot accept unlabeled or dented cans, any open packaging, products that need to be refrigerated, homemade foods, or expired products.</strong></em><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Don’t miss what promises to be one of the most compelling NYC tech talks of the year! <a href="http://trillionsensorsroadmap.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank"><strong>RSVP HERE</strong></a>.<br/></span></p>
