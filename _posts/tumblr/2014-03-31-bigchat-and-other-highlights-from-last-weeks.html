<p>Last week Gilt partnered up with <a href="http://digbigdata.com/" target="_blank">DigBigData</a> to offer a <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/03/06/our-next-free-tech-course-at-gilt-dublin-a-hands-on" target="_blank">free Cassandra workshop</a> near our Dublin office. Twenty-five technologists from Gilt and other area companies came together for a full day of hands-on learning, experimentation and fun! By workshop&rsquo;s end the teams had created several exciting projects, including a CPU temperature monitor, a tweet sentiment analyzer, a multi-player, web-based game, and <strong><a href="https://github.com/noelking/bigchat" target="_blank">BigChat</a></strong>&ndash;a SnapChat-inspired service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is always gratifying to see a group of people who may or may not know each other go from being individuals to getting together and forming cohesive teams and producing real mini projects with Cassandra,&rdquo; says Niall Milton, our instructor for the day. Thanks to Niall and all our attendees for making our learning day so memorable!</p>
