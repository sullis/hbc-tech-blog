<p><a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/10/06/on-being-a-woman-member-of-gilts-tech-team" target="_blank">#gilttech does</a>. To this end, we hosted a roundtable discussion last night featuring more than 25 representatives from some of NYC&rsquo;s top girls- and women-in-tech organizations. We wanted to hear more about their experiences trying to involve girls and women in tech, and about the challenges they and/or their group members have faced along the way. Other goals:</p>
<ul><li>To gather organizations working on helping girls and women enter the tech industry by providing coding instruction, mentoring, and other resources/forms of support</li>
<li>To put like-minded, successful organizers in touch and facilitate networking+brainstorming</li>
<li>To discuss bias (including the <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/resources/unconscious-bias-and-why-it-matters-women-and-tech" target="_blank">unconscious</a> type) and ways to address/resolve it at different levels (from C- to team-)</li>
<li>To identify action items for the group to work on</li>
</ul><p>Everyone brought valuable insights and a wealth of experience to the table, which made for a very lively and informative conversation. Participants focused on implementing positive changes that involve and benefit everyone in the tech industry (after all, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-05/women-help-startups-succeed-dot-when-will-vcs-notice" target="_blank">more women = higher profits</a>). The general consensus is that men need to be a part of our future conversations and our efforts to propose solutions.</p>
