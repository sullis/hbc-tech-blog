<p>Our friends at Sauce Labs recently invited Gilt Senior Software Engineer Matt Isaacs to <a href="http://sauceio.com/index.php/2014/06/guest-post-automating-mobile-testing-at-gilt-a-follow-up/" target="_blank">write a post</a> about how we&rsquo;ve been using Appium in our ongoing automated mobile testing efforts. &ldquo;Appium has grown up!&rdquo; Matt writes. &ldquo;Appium now implements the defined part of the Mobile JSON Wire Protocol. This is basically an extension to the Selenium wire protocol, which provides support for mobile specific actions. Desired capability keys seem to have been finalized by this spec, which is great, since these have changed a couple times over the past year, causing a couple of headaches. It’s also good to see some bigger companies getting involved here.&rdquo;</p>
