<p>Archana Kumar is a front-end engineer who recently joined our Gilt City team in NYC. Originally from India, she went to college in Melbourne, Australia and did her graduate studies at NYU. She&rsquo;s excited to be working on the Gilt tech team, and has already earned a playful nickname around the office: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s That?&quot;  She has one dog, one husband, and a side career as a web-comic artist.</p>
