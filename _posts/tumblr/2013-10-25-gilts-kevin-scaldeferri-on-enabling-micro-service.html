<p>If you&rsquo;ve read about Gilt&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/20/gilts-development-deployment-infrastructure-slides" target="_blank">microservices architecture</a> but always wanted to learn more, you&rsquo;re in luck: Here&rsquo;s a video of Gilt Principal Engineer Kevin Scaldeferri presenting at last month&rsquo;s Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) conference in Boston. Kevin’s talk focused on the evolution of Gilt’s production architecture from a single monolithic web application to a highly-distributed collection of more than 200 micro-services and small web applications. Structuring our services this way helps us to deploy and innovate faster and more efficiently. </p>
