<p>Four of us on the Data Engineering team spent the week before Super Storm Sandy at the Teradata Partners conference. It&rsquo;s essentially a massive, week-long, Teradata-sponsored meetup hosting &gt;250 Data Warehouse/Analytics presentations.</p>
<p>Both Chris and Deep presented for the first time. (See pictures below!) </p>
<p>Chris spoke about his pricing work using R linear mixed effect regression and random forest parallelized across our data warehouse cluster.</p>
<p>Deep spoke about parallelizing webservice calls from our Data Warehouse cluster (specifically against Google) and potential for sort of distributed Data Warehouse or external ETL.</p>
<p>To our delight Gilt was also prominently featured in a skit on the main screen during the conference&rsquo;s kickoff. </p>
<p>What remains of Foreigner played a concert. (Deep had no idea who they were) Malcolm Gladwell and John Cleese also spoke.</p>
<p>Overall the conference was a great for the team to generate new ideas, appreciate how technically advanced we are, and get perspective on capital &lsquo;E&rsquo; enterprise data volumes. </p>
