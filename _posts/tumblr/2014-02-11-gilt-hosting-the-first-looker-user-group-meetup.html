<p><br/>Tonight the Gilt Data Team hosts the first-ever <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Looker-User-Group-NY/events/156298422/" target="_blank">Looker User Group</a> meetup in NYC! Looker is a data tool that we&rsquo;re excited about at Gilt&ndash;it does a great job of  providing easy access to information, and is helping us to make our data more accessible to everyone company-wide. &ldquo;Seriously, <em>everyone</em>,&rdquo; says Gilt Director of Data Engineering Geoff Guerdat. &ldquo;And it does this while maintaining data definitions, which is important if you&rsquo;re concerned with all that data governance nerdy stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s meetup begins at 6:30 PM and features presentations by Geoff and reps from Upworthy and Frank &amp; Oak. Looker reps will also be on hand to answer questions and provide a Looker update. Food and drink provided!</p>
