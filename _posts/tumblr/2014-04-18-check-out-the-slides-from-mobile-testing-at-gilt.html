<p>This past Wednesday, Gilt Senior Software Engineer Matt Isaacs presented a talk at the <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/16/brooklyn-ios-developer-meetup-features-gilt" target="_blank">Brooklyn iOS Developer meetup</a> on how we do mobile testing&ndash;and if you couldn&rsquo;t make it, then check out the slides above! Almost half of the Gilt Mobile team came out to the event to watch/support Matt and hear talks from other companies, including FiftyThree&ndash;whose amazing <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/" target="_blank">Pencil</a> is something that several of us definitely covet&ndash;and CBS Sports. Thanks to meetup organizers Jeff and Stela for inviting us to present!</p>
