<p><span><span>Our Data team held their very first Looker hackathon and kicked off what promises to be an exciting year-long project that will impact many different Gilt departments. Lead engineers and analysts from Looker came to our NYC office to help us throughout the day. &ldquo;We started work and expanded on over 10 new data models in the tool,&rdquo; says Gilt Business Intelligence Engineer George Chien. &ldquo;We also identified several new enhancements that we’ve suggested to Looker. Our team will be instrumental in shaping the tool’s development roadmap.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s Director of Data Engineering Geoff Guerdat at the screen, leading the way. </span></span></p>
