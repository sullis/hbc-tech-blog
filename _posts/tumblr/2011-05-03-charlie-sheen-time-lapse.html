<p>On Friday, Apr 29th (the day of the Royal Wedding!), I recorded about 6 hours or so of Warlock running. I then sped it up until it was about 18 minutes long, and chopped off the beginning and end. What&rsquo;s left is a time lapse of incoming orders arranged geospatially.</p>

<p>Fast forward to about <code>6:00</code> to see the big burst of traffic we get at noon.</p>
