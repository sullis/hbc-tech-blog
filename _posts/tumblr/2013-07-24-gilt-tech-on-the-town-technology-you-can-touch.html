<p>With so much of the NYC tech scene focused on software development, web development, and cloud-y things, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook all the innovation taking place in the city&rsquo;s clean tech, bioscience, robotics, and other hard-science scenes. One of the organizations working to promote the hard sciences locally is <a href="http://nyctechconnect.com/" target="_blank">NY Tech Connect</a>, a nonprofit organization that creates programs and events for start-ups and entrepreneurs that make tangible products. Last night I attended NY Tech Connect&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://nyctechconnect.com/tech-you-can-touch.html" target="_blank">Technology You Can Touch</a>,&rdquo; a showcase of sorts at <a href="https://www.wework.com/" target="_blank">WeWork</a> that featured these young companies:</p>
<p><a href="http://studentweb.poly.edu/~innovention/bot-factory/" target="_blank"><strong>BOT Factory</strong></a>: Founded by a pair of NYU students, BOT Factory is working on a 3D circuit printer so that you can one day make circuit boards in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keyme.net/" target="_blank"><strong>KeyMe</strong></a>: Disrupting the locksmithing industry, KeyMe enables you to make copies of your house and office keys and store digital copies in the cloud. The company has already set up key-making kiosks at a few locations in NYC, so if you&rsquo;re in the habit of losing your keys you might find this one useful.</p>
<p><a href="http://columbiabusinesslab.com/ventures/" target="_blank"><strong>Radicle Orthopedics</strong></a>: Part of the Columbia Business Lab, Radicle works with surgeons and medical device manufacturers on healthcare-related products.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.strongarmvest.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Strongarm Vest</strong></a>: Not to be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Bad" target="_blank">Strongbad <em>mask</em></a>, Strongarm Vest helps make lifting heavy objects easier and safer by redistributing weight from the arms and lower back to the stronger parts of the torso. A winner of the Rochester and New York State Business Plan Competitions, Strongarm was inspired by the founders&rsquo; own experiences watching their construction-worker relatives deal with pains and injuries sustained on the job.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lumiode.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Lumiode</strong></a>: Based in Brooklyn, this company focuses on making super-bright, energy-efficient, LED micro-displays.</p>
<p><a href="http://mykeenhome.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Keen Home</strong></a>: This company&rsquo;s automated air vents are designed to reduce excessive air conditioning and HVAC run times (by up to 30 percent, they claim).</p>
<p><a href="http://canary.is/" target="_blank"><strong>Canary</strong></a>: Billed by its founders as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s first smart home security device for everyone,&rdquo; Canary alerts you via smartphone to suspicious or out-of-the-ordinary goings-on at your home. Canary launched a $100,000 Indiegogo campaign just this week and has already surpassed the $500,000 mark, so expect to hear lots more from them.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Coactive</strong>: This company works in the area of vibration technology. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.onemedplace.com/database/list/cid/16322/" target="_blank">Vesselon</a>: </strong>This healthcare start-up is developing a device that will enable paramedics to treat stroke victims as early as possible and, they hope, improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Looking forward to what NY Tech Connect and the companies above present next. Congrats to all involved for creating a thought-provoking and inspiring event.</p>
