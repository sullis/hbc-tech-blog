<p>The friendly folks at Typesafe have just released the CFP for next year&rsquo;s <a href="http://scaladays.org/" target="_blank">Scala Days</a> conference, which takes place June 16-18 in Berlin. If you&rsquo;re a sophisticated Scalasmith with some keen insights on Typesafe platform technologies, consider submitting a proposal before the deadline date of Nov. 29. Meantime, derive some inspiration by revisiting Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman&rsquo;s Scala Days &lsquo;13 presentation on &ldquo;<a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/11/gilt-tech-presents-at-scala-days-slides" target="_blank">Scala &amp; Symmetry</a>&rdquo; (Gilt was a platinum sponsor of this year&rsquo;s conf, held in NYC).</p>
