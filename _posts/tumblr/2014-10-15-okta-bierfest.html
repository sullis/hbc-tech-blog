<p>Today Gilt corporate applications&ndash;the team responsible for managing our OKTA services, among <em>many many </em>other things&ndash;put their own spin on Octoberfest by generously hosting a company-wide &ldquo;OKTA-bierfest&rdquo; celebration. The team covered our IT help desk with buckets of Yonkers Brewery bier and platters of cheese (both &ldquo;standard&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/02/07/fancy-cheese-friday" target="_blank">fancy</a>&rdquo; varieties, cupcakes, fruits &lsquo;n&rsquo; nuts, and homemade pretzels. We&rsquo;ve had several office parties since fall officially kicked off, but this one has generated the most buzz among tech&ndash;<em>so far</em>.</p>
