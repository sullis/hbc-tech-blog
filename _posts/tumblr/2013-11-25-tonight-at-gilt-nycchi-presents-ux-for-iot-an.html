</ul><blockquote>
<p><span class="vevent"><span class="description"><span><span>The Internet of Things (IoT) and Natural User Interfaces (NUI) are rapidly transforming how we live and interact. 2013 has marked a turning point with a confluence of near-universal mobile and device connectivity; rapidly standardizing data protocols and platforms and the advent of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; analytics; and the rise of alternate means of consumer interactions with digital devices through voice, gaze, touch, and motion. </span>I<span>oT and NUI present exciting challenges for UX professionals to consider new means of interactions beyond just the screen, mouse and keyboard, with new types of input and management of data as well as the marriage of hardware products and digital software design. </span></span></span></span></p>
