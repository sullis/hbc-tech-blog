<p>How do you create and maintain a great company culture? What does “culture” even mean? We often simplify the idea of culture (especially in tech) as pertaining to physical objects or events such as ping pong tables or happy hours. But what does culture mean in the context of scaling a healthy, happy organization that is productive, collaborative, and diverse?</p><p>Senior Director, Heather Fleming has been invited to be on the panel discussing these topics and we hope you’ll join us for the conversation!</p><p>Tickets are free, but space is limited, so <a href="https://nvite.com/letstalkculture/e66b" target="_blank">RSVP to attend</a>!</p>
