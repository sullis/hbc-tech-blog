<p>Gilt gives a hearty welcome to Christopher Poenaru, who joins Team Popeye (personalization) for the summer! Chris comes to us through the co-op program at Canada&rsquo;s prestigious University of Waterloo, where he is a third-year student. He&rsquo;s passionate about new technologies and loves trying his hand with new languages and frameworks.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s not in front of the computer, Chris loves to travel and try new things. Like many a Gilt technologist he&rsquo;s an avid cyclist and runner, and enjoys competing in triathlons. It’s his first time living in NYC, but not his first experience living abroad: he spent just shy of a decade<br/>living as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid" target="_blank">TCK</a> in Kenya. We&rsquo;re grateful to have him join us!</p>
