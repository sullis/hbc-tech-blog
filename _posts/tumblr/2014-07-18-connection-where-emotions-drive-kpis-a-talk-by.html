<p>How does Gilt create connections with our millions of customers around the world? What is the difference between &ldquo;personalization at Gilt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gilt personae&rdquo;? Who is &ldquo;the Gilt customer,&rdquo; and how does the Gilt team identify him and her? And how has Gilt used A/B testing to better serve our customers? Gilt CIO Steve Jacobs will address these and many other questions as the featured speaker of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/njtech/events/173992312/" target="_blank">NJ Tech Meetup</a>&rsquo;s July 22 event!</p>
