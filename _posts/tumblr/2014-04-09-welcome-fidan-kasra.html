<p>Yesterday we introduced you to Program Manager <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/08/welcome-justin-vitale" target="_blank">Justin Vitale</a> and his favorite furnishings. Today we welcome Fidan Kasra, who also joins our Program Management Office as a Senior Program Manager! Fidan will be working with our distribution team, which is part of Gilt&rsquo;s Back Office.<br/><br/>Originally from Texas, Fidan just moved to New York City from Germany, where she worked at a major ecommerce company as a project manager in charge of logistics projects. Prior to that, Fidan worked as a consultant&ndash;helping fashion retailers around the globe with supply-chain and merchandising initiatives. She&rsquo;s passionate about retail operations and technology, and we&rsquo;re ecstatic to have her join the team!</p>
<p>In her spare time Fidan likes to travel and explore different cultures and languages. And despite her Texas roots, she owns no cowboy boots.</p>
