<p><span>The Seattle-based loyalty platform BigDoor recently ranked Gilt </span><a href="http://gilt.com/insider%20" target="_blank"><span>Insider</span></a><span> fifth on its “Top 10 Retail Loyalty Programs” list for 2013! “Gilt has taken the traditional retail model and flipped it on its head, yielding some pretty incredible results for the brand,” Big Door writes. “It’s clear that they’ve intensely studied their customer behavior patterns in order to create incentives that match the actions customers are already taking. This type of customer direction is the</span><a href="http://bigdoor.com/blog/2013/10/24/rewards-the-best-choice-for-brands-building-reciprocal-loyalty/" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>marketing of the future</span></a><span>, and Gilt is already leaps and bounds ahead of its competitors.” Other companies named to Big Door’s list include Starbucks, Best Buy and Walgreens.</span></p>
<p><span>Launched in July, Insider allows Gilt members to earn points simply by interacting with Gilt.com, GiltCity.com, and mobile experiences for both—whether it’s by purchasing a cool product, referring a friend, or even visiting a sale. Members can redeem points for perks like early access to daily sales, exclusive merchandise and Insider-only events (in addition to free shipping and percent-off discounts). As members earn Insider points, they achieve status in one of three program tiers. The higher the tier, the more perks: like wait-list priority and a dedicated concierge service.</span></p>
<p><span>“Gilt has truly defined the customer actions that are most important to the brand, and incentivize accordingly in order to drive engagement,” as Big Door observes.</span></p>
<p><span>As for “marketing of the future”: be on the lookout for several exciting Insider program enhancements in the months to come. These include deeper mobile integration, more ways to earn points and score free discounts, and exclusive deals from the best brands Gilt and Gilt City have to offer!</span></p>
