<p>After enjoying a relaxing (?) three-day weekend, get back into the heavy-duty tech-talk swing of things by coming to 2 Park on May 27 for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-Engineering-Meetup/" target="_blank">Full-Stack Engineering</a> meetup! Even compared to <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/full-stack+engineering" target="_blank">past FSE speaker lineups</a> this Tuesday&rsquo;s is especially strong, with presenters representing three of NYC&rsquo;s top tech companies:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Mike Brittain</strong>, Director of Engineering at Etsy, will discuss<strong> &ldquo;</strong>Advanced Topics in Continuous Delivery&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Wes Chow</strong>, CTO at Chartbeat, will present on &ldquo;Pseudorandomness in JavaScript&rdquo;</li>
<li>and last&ndash;but definitely not least&ndash;<strong>Will Chiong</strong>, Lead Software Engineer at Gilt, on &ldquo;Data-driven Personalization&rdquo;</li>
</ul><p>We&rsquo;ll have food, drink, and&ndash;with +200 RSVPs and a waitlist&ndash;lots of company! Hope to see you here.</p>
