<p><em><a href="http://www.gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt</a> recently released <a href="https://github.com/gilt/mockingbird-toolbox" target="_blank">Mockingbird Toolbox</a>, an open-source project for iOS intended to make common development tasks easier. The Toolbox is the basic building block of Mockingbird library, which will be released in stages over the coming months. Mockingbird serves as the base layer of Gilt’s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/28/we-won-the-webby" target="_blank">award</a>-winning <a href="http://www.gilt.com/apps/iphone" target="_blank">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.gilt.com/apps/ipad" target="_blank">iPad</a> applications.</em></p>
<p><em>This post is the first in a series that will be highlighting the code available in Mockingbird Toolbox and explaining how you can use it in your iOS projects.</em></p>
<h3>Modularity</h3>
<p>Modularity in software design is a key strategy for managing complexity. A well-crafted code module is:</p>
<ul><li><em>Focused</em> — it tries to do one main thing; anything else it does is in support of that</li>
<li><em>Isolated</em> — it reduces interconnections within code by providing a public API that minimizes the points of contact between modules</li>
<li><em>Well-behaved</em> — it doesn’t change global state in a way that interferes with other modules</li>
</ul><p>When separate modules need to interact with a <em>shared resource</em>, modularity becomes more difficult to attain.</p>
<p>In order to be well-behaved, modules need to use shared resources in a way that recognizes the fact that <em>other</em> modules may be using that resource, too.</p>
<p>One way to try to account for that might be to introduce a mechanism for modules to communicate with each other to ensure proper behavior with respect to the shared resource. But doing so would make the modules less focused and isolated.</p>
<p>Gilt’s mobile team faced these sorts of design decisions during the evolution of our iOS apps. One generic solution we built was <a href="https://rawgit.com/gilt/mockingbird-toolbox/master/Documentation/html/Classes/MBServiceManager.html" target="_blank"> the <code>MBServiceManager</code> class</a>, which we’ll discuss further in a future post.</p>
<p>But there was one specific shared resource that required its own solution: namely, the network indicator that appears in the status bar.</p>
<h3>The Status Bar Network Indicator</h3>
<p>The network indicator is the animated spinner that you sometimes see in the status bar, typically to the right of the other network information in the upper-left corner of the device screen.</p>
<p>The spinner doesn’t appear automatically; instead, applications are responsible for turning it on when they’re using the network, and turning it back off once they’re done. Displaying the network indicator is entirely optional, but polite applications are honest about when they’re consuming the user’s bandwidth.</p>
<p>Applications control the spinner through the <code>UIApplication</code>’s <code>networkActivityIndicatorVisible</code> property. Setting the value to <code>YES</code> causes the animated spinner to appear. Setting the property back to <code>NO</code> hides the spinner.</p>
<p>You might think that managing the network indicator is as simple as setting <code>networkActivityIndicatorVisible</code> to <code>YES</code> when an operation starts and back to <code>NO</code> when it finishes, but consider what happens when an app sends multiple network requests:</p>
<ol><li>Network operation A starts</li>
<li>Network operation B starts</li>
<li>Network operation B completes</li>
<li>Network operation C starts</li>
<li>Network operation A completes</li>
<li>Network operation C completes</li>
</ol><p>Under this scenario, the spinner <em>should</em> be animating from Step 1 through Step 6.</p>
<p>But that’s not what happens if we directly manipulate the <code>networkActivityIndicatorVisible</code> property at the start and end of each request. Instead, we get this behavior:</p>
<ol><li>Spinner appears</li>
<li><em>Spinner animating</em></li>
<li>Spinner disappears</li>
<li>Spinner appears</li>
<li>Spinner disappears</li>
<li><em>Spinner remains hidden</em></li>
</ol><p>Half the time, the network indicator is reflecting the wrong state.</p>
<p>Because the beginning and end of different network operations can be interleaved, the fact that there is only a single on/off value for the network indicator becomes problematic. If more than one set of code attempts to directly manipulate the value of <code>networkActivityIndicatorVisible</code>, we will get unexpected results.</p>
<h3>Network Indicator Coordination</h3>
<p>To avoid this problem, we decided upon creating a <em>coordinator</em> for the network indicator. The coordinator provides a simple interface for reporting when operations begin and end. Wherever network operations are performed, our code interacts with the coordinator, which in turn decides when to show and hide the spinner based on what’s happening across <em>the entire application</em> at any given moment.</p>
<p>The coordinator was designed to:</p>
<ul><li>Maintain a count of in-progress network operations
<ul><li>Whenever an operation starts, the count would increment</li>
<li>Whenever one completes, the count would decrement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Set <code>networkActivityIndicatorVisible</code> property to <code>YES</code> whenever the count increases from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set <code>networkActivityIndicatorVisible</code> property to <code>NO</code> whenever the count decreases from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operate correctly in a multi-threaded environment</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Introducing <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code></strong></h3>
<p>The public interface to our coordinator is provided by <a href="https://rawgit.com/gilt/mockingbird-toolbox/master/Documentation/html/Classes/MBNetworkIndicator.html" target="_blank">the <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> class</a>, part of <a href="https://github.com/gilt/mockingbird-toolbox" target="_blank">the Mockingbird Toolbox open-source project</a>.</p>
<p>Any code that issues network requests can maintain one or more <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> objects. Each instance is intended to represent one or more related network operations occurring on a single thread. While those operations are in progress, the <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instance is kept around, and is notified when operations begin and end.</p>
<p>The API consists of three instance methods:</p>
<ul><li><code>operationStarted</code> — Called whenever a network operation begins</li>
<li><code>operationFinished</code> — Called whenever a network operation completes</li>
<li><code>cancelOperations</code> — Called to signal that <em>all</em> in-progress operations associated with that specific instance should be considered finished (equivalent to calling <code>operationFinished</code> once for each in-progress operation)</li>
</ul><h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Every <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instance maintains a counter of network operations that is incremented for each call to its <code>operationStarted</code> method and decremented for each call to its <code>operationFinished</code> method.</p>
<p>Calls to those methods also update a <em>master counter</em>, which keeps a single, application-wide count of in-progress operations.</p>
<p>You can think of it this way:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The count maintained by any given <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instance is equal to (the number of times its <code>operationStarted</code> method was called) minus (the number of times its <code>operationFinished</code> method was called)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The master count is equal to (the number of times <code>operationStarted</code> was called on <em>all</em> <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instances) minus (the number of times <code>operationFinished</code> was called on <em>all</em> <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instances)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Whenever the master count of network operations is greater than zero, the status bar network indicator is displayed. Otherwise, when there are no operations, the indicator is hidden.</p>
<h3>Canceling Operations</h3>
<p>Let’s say you have a <code>UINavigationController</code>-based app, and any given <code>UIViewController</code> pushed onto the navigation stack could result in multiple network requests being issued. Further, you handle the user tapping the <strong>Back</strong> button by hooking into <code>viewWillDisappear:</code> to cancel any network operations that haven’t yet finished.</p>
<p>In such a case, you might opt to have each <code>UIViewController</code> maintain its own <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instance. You would call <code>operationStarted</code> and <code>operationFinished</code> as requests are processed normally. But within <code>viewWillDisappear:</code>, you would call <code>cancelOperations</code> to signal that <em>all</em> pending operations for that view controller have been cancelled.</p>
<p>Calling <code>cancelOperations</code> is equivalent to calling <code>operationFinished</code> once for each pending operation.</p>
<h3>Maintaining References</h3>
<p>To ensure that the master counter balances over time, <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> assumes that when an instance is deallocated, it is a signal that there are no related network operations still pending. (This is achieved by a call to <code>cancelOperations</code> from within <code>dealloc</code>.)</p>
<p>Because of this, you are expected to maintain strong references to <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instances that are still tracking pending operations.</p>
<h3>Thread Safety</h3>
<p>Because individual network operations are bound to specific threads, <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instances are designed to be used only on a single thread; instances <em>must not</em> be shared across threads.</p>
<p>However, the underlying mechanism that maintains the master counter and manages showing and hiding the network activity indicator <em>is</em> thread-safe.</p>
<p>The mechanism uses functions declared in <code>&lt;libkern/OSAtomic.h&gt;</code> to ensure that the master counter is handled correctly when several <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> instances are in simultaneous use on multiple threads.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Next</strong></p>
<p>Our <code>MBNetworkIndicator</code> class is just one way to manage a shared resource while adhering to the principles of modularity.</p>
