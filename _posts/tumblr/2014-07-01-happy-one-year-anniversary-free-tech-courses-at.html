<p>It was one year ago today that we held <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/20/sign-up-for-free-scala-training-at-gilt" target="_blank">our first free tech course at Gilt</a>: an Introduction to Scala course hosted by our NYC office! Since then we&rsquo;ve hosted twelve additional <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/free+tech+courses" target="_blank">free courses</a> in Scala, Hadoop, Machine Learning, Cassandra, AngularJS, and several other topics. Nearly 500 non-Gilt folks in NYC and Dublin have joined us for our full-day, classroom-style sessions, taught by Gilt technologists and external experts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to bring you many more free courses over the coming months, including next week&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/06/27/gilts-next-free-tech-course-in-dublin-angularjs" target="_blank">AngularJS session in Dublin</a> and our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/06/30/gilts-hosting-a-free-sbt-workshop-with-josh-suereth-of" target="_blank">July 14 sbt workshop</a> with Josh Suereth of Typesafe; just click the respective links to apply.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a tech expert who would like to pitch us for a course, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/gilttech" target="_blank">ping us via Twitter</a>. (Dublin or NYC residents only, unless you plan on swinging through one of these towns sometime over the next year.)</p>
