<p>Earlier this week Gilt&rsquo;s tech team in NYC hosted a lunchtime tech talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/imsnakes" target="_blank">Matt Reiferson</a>, the CTO (&ldquo;Control Tower Operator&rdquo;) of the New York based consumer web company Torando Labs. Matt&rsquo;s speaking at this weekend&rsquo;s <a href="http://gophercon.com/" target="_blank">GopherCon</a> in Denver, Colo. and came over to do a trial run of his presentation, &ldquo;Spray Some NSQ On It.&quot;His abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NSQ is a real-time distributed messaging platform, built entirely in Go, that promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee.</p>
<p>It was built to support Bitly&rsquo;s data engineering systems and has continued to grow in adoption to power infrastructure at Path, Hailo, Life360, Trendrr, Simplereach, and others. It is a vibrant member of the Go open source community.</p>
<p>Building easy-to-operate, large scale, high volume distributed systems for production tends to present unique and interesting problems that stretch ones assumptions.</p>
<p>This talk is the product of our experience developing NSQ and operating Go services in production.</p>
<p>It covers the evolution of bitly&rsquo;s infrastructure to the design and implementation of NSQ, a match made in heaven for Go. This includes the challenge of optimizing a garbage collected language, managing those pesky goroutines, and a healthy dose of distributed systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find NSQ <a href="https://github.com/bitly/nsq" target="_blank">here at Bitly&rsquo;s GitHub page</a>. Thanks to Matt for spending the afternoon with us, and to Gilt Mobile Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/ruxy+staicut" target="_blank">Ruxy Staicut</a> for organizing!</p>
