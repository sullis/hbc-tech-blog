<p><strong>Featured Presentation:</strong> <em><strong>&ldquo;Fast but Not Loose: Typesafe Clients in a Distributed Service Architecture, a Retrospective&rdquo; by Eric Bowman</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://gilt.com" target="_blank">Gilt</a> is an innovative online shopping destination that offers its members special access to inspiring merchandise, culinary offerings, and experiences every day, many at insider prices. Every day at noon EST, Gilt launches dozens of new sales that draw many thousands of visitors to the site&ndash;often within the span of a few seconds. As a result, Gilt has some challenging <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/" target="_blank">technical</a> and non-functional requirements. Our Architecture Team focuses on how to scale Gilt&rsquo;s model to accommodate more sales, more customers, and more people working on the system.</p>
<p>Gilt&rsquo;s service architecture started as Ruby and migrated to the JVM, but kept a hashmaps and JSON approach, and then migrated again to a typesafe, futures-based strong client model implemented in Scala. This talk is a retrospective on our journey, with particular emphasis on the last approach. What are the benefits of a strong client model? When did it slow down development, and when did it speed it up? How did we handle binary compatibility across hundreds of services (or did we??)? How do we guarantee compatibility across multiple versions of the client stack?  Would we do it this way again?</p>
<p><strong>Gilt Senior Software Engineer Lukasz Szwed:</strong> This presentation will focus on standard test-driven development practices available to Scala developers, including scalatest, Spec2, Mocking and ScalaCheck.</p>
