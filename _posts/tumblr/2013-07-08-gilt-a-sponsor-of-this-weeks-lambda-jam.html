<p>Gilt&rsquo;s proud to be the lanyard sponsor of this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://lambdajam.com" target="_blank">Lambda Jam</a> conference for functional programmers, taking place now through July 10 in Chicago. Among this year&rsquo;s featured presenters is Gilt software engineer Kevin Scaldeferri, who earlier today gave a talk on &ldquo;<a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#scaldeferri" target="_blank">Enabling Microservice Architectures with Scala</a>.&rdquo; Kevin&rsquo;s presentation focused on the many interesting ways that we use Scala at Gilt&ndash;from using the cake pattern to bridge the divide between unit testing and functional testing, to creating an SBT uber-plugin to abstract and unify our development process.</p>
<p>In addition to talks, each day of Lambda Jam includes hours of hands-on workshops on <a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#raychaudhuri" target="_blank">Scala</a>, <a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#feldman" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#vinoski" target="_blank">Riak</a>, and other technologies. Chicago in the summertime is a great place to be, so hopefully some of you are reading this from the Windy City!</p>
