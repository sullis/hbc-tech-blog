<p>It&rsquo;s been great to hear from developers over the past two weeks about their plans for the Gilt Public API, and we can only imagine what&rsquo;s in the works out there that we haven&rsquo;t heard about yet! Meanwhile, back at Gilt HQ, we&rsquo;re hard at work on adding more to the API— more data and more ways of accessing what you want in the easiest way possible.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, I&rsquo;m happy to announce that we&rsquo;ve finally got everything in place to enable you to participate in the affiliate marketing program. By enrolling in this program and adding a single parameter to all the requests you pass in, you can earn a competitive 6% commission on all sales from referred customers. When you consider that the luxury items on Gilt lead to <em>average</em> total order values of $150, that adds up pretty quickly.</p>
