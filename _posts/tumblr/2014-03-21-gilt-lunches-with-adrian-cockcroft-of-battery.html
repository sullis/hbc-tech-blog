<p>A few weeks ago the Gilt technology team learned via Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/matlockx" target="_blank">Martin</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/adrianco" target="_blank">Adrian Cockcroft</a> featured Gilt&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/micro-services" target="_blank">micro-services architecture</a> in his <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/03/06/gilts-micro-services-architecture-gets-a-mention-at" target="_blank">presentation</a> at QCon London. Adrian is the former Chief Architect for High Performance Technical Computing at Sun Microsystems (and author of the best-selling <em>Sun Performance and Tuning </em>book), founding member of eBay Research Labs, former Cloud Architect at Netflix (he helped lead Netflix’s migration to a large scale, highly available public-cloud architecture and the open sourcing of the cloud-native NetflixOSS platform), and current Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures. Adrian was in New York City today and stopped by our office for lunch and a chat with some of our engineers. On the menu: falafel and kebabs from <a href="http://www.alibabaturkishcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Ali Baba</a>:</p>

<p>We had a fantastic time listening to Adrian talk about his experiences and current work. Thanks to him for taking time out of his busy schedule to visit!</p>
