<p>A year ago, &ldquo;R&rdquo; meant no more to me than any other letter of the English alphabet. Today, it represents the door that has opened a host of opportunities and a newly discovered passion into the data science world.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with R, it is an <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">open-source programming language</a> that’s widely used by statisticians and data scientists to explore data sets and conduct analyses. I first stumbled into R last fall, when I signed up for the Intro to Data Science course at Columbia University. As a second-year grad student at Columbia&rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health, I was lured in by all of the buzz about data science and interested in learning &ldquo;<em>enough about programming to be able to speak to developers.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the first day of lab, I received an email stating that our session was rescheduled to the following day because our professor had a scheduling conflict with the <u>New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup</u>. This presented a scheduling conflict for <em>me</em>—I had to work that day. Furious about having to miss my first Data Science session, I Googled our professor, <u>Jared Lander</u>, to see what his deal was.</p>
<p>Not only did I learn that Jared the organizer of the aforementioned meetup, but that he’s also the author of <em><u>R for Everyone</u></em>, a corporate trainer of <u>R and data science</u>, and the founder of his own consulting business. In conducting my Google search, I discovered that he was teaching a <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/09/17/next-free-tech-course-at-gilt-r" target="_blank">free, day-long R course at Gilt</a> the next week, and immediately signed up to attend. In my application, I candidly wrote, <em>&ldquo;Jared is my professor, and I really need help on my homework.&quot; </em></p>
<p>In retrospect, I am incredibly grateful to Gilt for accepting me to the course for a couple of reasons. First, it saved my sanity that week, as I felt more prepared and better equipped to complete the assignment I was working on at the time. And most importantly, it was the first time I realized that I really enjoy coding. Little did I know that, one year out, I&rsquo;d <em>still</em> be coding&ndash;and passionately helping others to code as well. </p>
<p> Since taking Gilt’s R class, I&rsquo;ve continued to pursue my ambitions in data science by <a href="http://www.vivianpeng.com/" target="_blank">building data visualizations</a> that raise awareness of public health issues. And just this week, I got the opportunity to assist Jared in his training course at a big investment-banking firm in NYC. It&rsquo;s funny how life comes full-circle, and how the frustrations of our present can pave the way for possibilities in our futures.</p>
<p>Thank you Gilt and Jared Lander for setting me on this path!</p>
