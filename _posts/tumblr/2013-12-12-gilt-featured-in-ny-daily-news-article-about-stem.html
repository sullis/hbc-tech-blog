<p>This week the <em>New York Daily News </em><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/nyc-schools-stem-tide-unemployment-science-math-article-1.1542791" target="_blank">published an article</a> on our November visit with some very special guests: A group of girls from the Bronx Academy for Software Engineering! In addition to learning from some of Gilt&rsquo;s women technologists about roles in business systems management, UX/design, project management and software development, the girls worked on an HTML app, shared lunch with the team, and took a tour of our office. They also got to meet and hear a talk from Gilt CEO Michelle Peluso, who told the <em>NYDN </em>that it was &ldquo;wonderful to be able to give these girls a boost. It’s inspiring to all of us.&rdquo; Agreed!</p>
