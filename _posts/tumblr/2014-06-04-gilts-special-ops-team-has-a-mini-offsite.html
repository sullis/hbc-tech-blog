<p><span>Today Gilt&rsquo;s Special Ops team worked remotely from my apartment so we could wait for a special UPS delivery.* Formed earlier this year, Special Ops handles end-to-end (email to desktop to mobile) projects that don&rsquo;t fit under the umbrella of other product-driven teams. Since January we&rsquo;ve worked on projects related to customer service, holiday, business development, mobile, push notifications, and more. <span>At the moment, we are working to make the desktop experience responsive on the mobile device. </span></span></p>
<p>Here are our tips for successfully working remotely as a team:</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong>:</p>
<p><span>Instrumental music is key. I live in Ira Gershwin&rsquo;s former apartment, so we listened to <em>Gershwin Plays Gershwin</em> in the morning and then switched to Latin jazz in the afternoon. <br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Pro tip:</strong> No headphones.</span></p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>:</p>
<p><span>We thought about leaving the apartment, but there was a possibility that UPS would attempt to deliver the package while we were gone. So, we chose Seamless with the goal of leaving the apartment after the package was delivered.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re waiting for a package, don’t leave the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Meetings</strong>:</p>
<p>We hooked up Google Hangouts to a television in the room for our weekly review meeting. It&rsquo;s too bad Kinect (cough Microsoft cough) doesn&rsquo;t connect to Google Hangouts, but we still had a way to communicate with anyone and everyone as a group.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>cough Microsoft cough</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>:</p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;re right next to a park, so we celebrated the end of our UPS-inspired-offsite with a picnic with beers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don’t forget your Frisbee.</p>
<p><strong>Gear:</strong></p>
<p><span>Remember your charger, mouse, mouse pad, and&ndash;of course&ndash;the Jose special: a Starbucks grande iced coffee one pump classic with soy.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If your host is a coffee snob, do <em>not</em> bring the Starbucks iced coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip addendum:</strong> If you are the host and you are a coffee snob, tell Jose to drink his iced coffee outside before entering your apartment.</p>

<p><span>* <em>The delivery was <strong>not</strong> a controlled substance but some nightstands. That&rsquo;s right: Greg&rsquo;s team went over to his house just so he could intercept his bedroom furniture. That&rsquo;s some amazing team-building right there!&ndash;Lauri/Editor</em><br/></span></p>
