<p>We all have a lot to do. Effective time/task management is essential. I&rsquo;ve been using GTD (Getting Things Done) for a while now (a long while :)) and for me it comes down to the question, &ldquo;How do you pick the next, best, most valuable thing to work on?&rdquo;&ndash;basically answering the question of how to make the best use of the time you have.</p>
<p>Picking something from your list of urgent things to do is kind of easy, but how can you make sure you are not missing the opportunity/chance to work on something important, if you get the chance to do so?</p>
<p>For me, picking something from my important list comes down to two questions:</p>
<ul><li>How much time do I have? Ten minutes? Thirty minutes? An hour?</li>
<li>Do I need other people to help me, or can I make progress on my own?</li>
</ul><p>Doing something short on my own is easy. In general, it means that I try to pick a task that requires other people to be available and that takes a long time (an hour or more).</p>
