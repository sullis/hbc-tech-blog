### HBC Digital Technology Meetup - December 15

We're partnering with the NYC PostgreSQL User Group on Thursday, December 15 at 6:30pm to host [Bruce Momjian](http://momjian.us/main/resume.html#biography).

Here's the description of Bruce's talk:

Postgres 9.6 adds many features that take the database to a new level of scalability, with parallelism and multi-CPU-socket scaling improvements.

Easier maintenance is achieved by reduced cleanup overhead and adding snapshot and idle-transaction controls. Enhanced monitoring simplifies the job of administrators. Foreign data wrapper and full text improvements are also included in this release. The talk will also cover some of the major focuses of the next major release, Postgres 10.

Speaker: Bruce Momjian is co-founder and core team member of the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, and has worked on PostgreSQL since 1996. He has been employed by EnterpriseDB since 2006. He has spoken at many international open-source conferences and is the author of PostgreSQL: Introduction and Concepts, published by Addison-Wesley. Prior to his involvement with PostgreSQL, Bruce worked as a consultant, developing 
custom database applications for some of the world's largest law firms.

As an academic, Bruce holds a Masters in Education, was a high school computer science teacher, and lectures internationally at universities.
