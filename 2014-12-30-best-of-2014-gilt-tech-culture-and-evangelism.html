While we miss our old view of the Liffey, we’ve welcomed the opportunity to host meetups and free courses&ndash;as well as paper airplane contests, movie nights, and Gregorweens&ndash;in our own home. Martin Odersky Visits Gilt Friends and followers of Gilt Tech know that we’re a proud Scala shop, so having the actual creator of the Scala programming language visit our NYC office was pretty awesome. In May, Dr. Martin Odersky gave two talks in one day at Gilt: An afternoon Q&amp;A session with our engineering team, and an evening presentation for the tech community. In addition to being a brilliant computer scientist, Dr. Odersky is incredibly humble and generous with his time. We Broke Bread (or Pizza) With Some Other Amazing People In addition to Dr. Odersky, other tech leaders who shared their knowledge and a meal with our team in 2014 included: Adrian Cockcroft of Battery Ventures Bear Douglas of Twitter (formerly of Facebook) Zola CEO Shan-Lyn Ma James Ward, Henrik Engström and Tim Kirk of Typesafe Dr. Roland Kuhn of Typesafe Node.js experts Cian Ó Maidín and Richard Rodger Gil Tene of Azul Systems Brandon Philips of CoreOS &ldquo;Father of Data Warehousing&rdquo; Bill Inmon Matt Reiferson of Torando Labs We Taught You Things Our free tech courses initiative continues to grow and grow. The courses we offered this year: NYC: Go Data Visualization Chef sbt Scala libraries AngularJS CartoDB Git/GitHub Hadoop Scala Dublin: AngularJS Scala (internal, ongoing) MongoDB Machine Learning Cassandra Hadoop And thanks to Uncubed, we&rsquo;re now getting to teach you online. Through Uncubed Edge, a new online platform, Lead Software Engineer Gregory Mazurek and Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert have created one-hour courses on responsive and adaptive design at Gilt (that&rsquo;s Greg) and saving time with MetaSQL (that&rsquo;s Igor). We Had Cool Interns University of Waterloo student Chris Poenaru took advantage of his school&rsquo;s co-op program to spend his summer with our engineering team, while University of Delaware senior Samantha Sabo spent hers with our Program Management Organization. Samantha wrote a blog post about her experience at Gilt: I sat in on sprint planning meetings and retrospectives, joined the team for social events, company softball games and team lunches, and observed how the program managers do their jobs. Every day I learned something new or developed a new skill. Lucky for us, Samantha was able to come back to Gilt for a few wintry weeks and intern some more&ndash;she&rsquo;ll be with us through the end of January 2015. If you&rsquo;d like to be a Gilt software engineering intern in summer 2015, go here to apply. The Plasma Prix Our tech teams in NYC and Dublin spent much of February learning how to drive PlasmaCars: small plastic cars usually steered by children, but hearty enough to accommodate a (svelte) 6’8” Gilt technologist. When we all got together for our Architecture Summit in NYC, we held the Plasma Prix: a race pitting the top ten-fastest PlasmaCar racers against each other in a bid for fame, glory, and trophies. Relive the magic by watching our movie about it. We Had Non-Vehicular Fun, Too Game night! Fancy Cheese Fridays (and Cheese-mageddons)! OKTA-bierfest! Gregorween! Gregorbier! Encrypting! NYCity-wide trivia victories! Zumo robot-making with the kids from Bronx Academy of Software Engineering! HipFoosball! White after Labor Day! Paper airplane contests! Wine, cheese, and filmmakers! Mini-offsites! Bagel brunching! Horse adoption! These are just some of the fun things we were all about in 2014. The Gilt Design Team Joins Tech Making sure that we’re as bold and innovative as possible about driving user engagement is one of our goals. With this in mind, we decided this summer to more tightly align our Web Design and User Experience teams&ndash;allowing for closer collaboration between UX, design, product, and front-end developers. With this unification we’ve generated greater momentum around strategic initiatives and evolving the customer experience."><meta property="og:description" content="At many companies, “technology evangelism” is about promoting products.

While we miss our old view of the Liffey, we’ve welcomed the opportunity to host meetups and free courses&ndash;as well as paper airplane contests, movie nights, and Gregorweens&ndash;in our own home. Martin Odersky Visits Gilt Friends and followers of Gilt Tech know that we’re a proud Scala shop, so having the actual creator of the Scala programming language visit our NYC office was pretty awesome. In May, Dr. Martin Odersky gave two talks in one day at Gilt: An afternoon Q&amp;A session with our engineering team, and an evening presentation for the tech community. In addition to being a brilliant computer scientist, Dr. Odersky is incredibly humble and generous with his time. We Broke Bread (or Pizza) With Some Other Amazing People In addition to Dr. Odersky, other tech leaders who shared their knowledge and a meal with our team in 2014 included: Adrian Cockcroft of Battery Ventures Bear Douglas of Twitter (formerly of Facebook) Zola CEO Shan-Lyn Ma James Ward, Henrik Engström and Tim Kirk of Typesafe Dr. Roland Kuhn of Typesafe Node.js experts Cian Ó Maidín and Richard Rodger Gil Tene of Azul Systems Brandon Philips of CoreOS &ldquo;Father of Data Warehousing&rdquo; Bill Inmon Matt Reiferson of Torando Labs We Taught You Things Our free tech courses initiative continues to grow and grow. The courses we offered this year: NYC: Go Data Visualization Chef sbt Scala libraries AngularJS CartoDB Git/GitHub Hadoop Scala Dublin: AngularJS Scala (internal, ongoing) MongoDB Machine Learning Cassandra Hadoop And thanks to Uncubed, we&rsquo;re now getting to teach you online. Through Uncubed Edge, a new online platform, Lead Software Engineer Gregory Mazurek and Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert have created one-hour courses on responsive and adaptive design at Gilt (that&rsquo;s Greg) and saving time with MetaSQL (that&rsquo;s Igor). We Had Cool Interns University of Waterloo student Chris Poenaru took advantage of his school&rsquo;s co-op program to spend his summer with our engineering team, while University of Delaware senior Samantha Sabo spent hers with our Program Management Organization. Samantha wrote a blog post about her experience at Gilt: I sat in on sprint planning meetings and retrospectives, joined the team for social events, company softball games and team lunches, and observed how the program managers do their jobs. Every day I learned something new or developed a new skill. Lucky for us, Samantha was able to come back to Gilt for a few wintry weeks and intern some more&ndash;she&rsquo;ll be with us through the end of January 2015. If you&rsquo;d like to be a Gilt software engineering intern in summer 2015, go here to apply. The Plasma Prix Our tech teams in NYC and Dublin spent much of February learning how to drive PlasmaCars: small plastic cars usually steered by children, but hearty enough to accommodate a (svelte) 6’8” Gilt technologist. When we all got together for our Architecture Summit in NYC, we held the Plasma Prix: a race pitting the top ten-fastest PlasmaCar racers against each other in a bid for fame, glory, and trophies. Relive the magic by watching our movie about it. We Had Non-Vehicular Fun, Too Game night! Fancy Cheese Fridays (and Cheese-mageddons)! OKTA-bierfest! Gregorween! Gregorbier! Encrypting! NYCity-wide trivia victories! Zumo robot-making with the kids from Bronx Academy of Software Engineering! HipFoosball! White after Labor Day! Paper airplane contests! Wine, cheese, and filmmakers! Mini-offsites! Bagel brunching! Horse adoption! These are just some of the fun things we were all about in 2014. The Gilt Design Team Joins Tech Making sure that we’re as bold and innovative as possible about driving user engagement is one of our goals. With this in mind, we decided this summer to more tightly align our Web Design and User Experience teams&ndash;allowing for closer collaboration between UX, design, product, and front-end developers. With this unification we’ve generated greater momentum around strategic initiatives and evolving the customer experience.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"HBC
