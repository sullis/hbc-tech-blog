Taking a nuanced, intentional, and planned approach to entering China is essential. It is with such...

            In making Gilt.com responsive to the mobile device, the Special Ops team identified several responsive patterns that we relied upon to “responsivize” our site layout. Identifying these patterns early on helped us to more confidently make subsequent responsive-related decisions. For our fourth responsive-related blog post, I would like to share how we discovered and implemented one of our favorite design patterns that we identified: the full-screen modal. The Gilt iPhone...

            In our last blog post on responsive design at Gilt, my colleague Greg Mazurek explained why we use in-selector CSS media-queries instead of blocks. The impetus for choosing this pattern was to make our code less brittle to future development. Today I’ll talk about how we’re applying the same principle to our testing practices. We’ve thought a lot about how we can design our code to minimize&ndash;even prevent&ndash;unexpected adverse changes...

            Lisp is an interesting language. Its emphasis on functional programming and properties such as homoiconicity make it quite different from other languages. Although it’s not suited for all developers, those who have experienced building large applications in other languages may appreciate the simplicity that Lisp provides. When I ask other developers for their thoughts on Lisp, the most common response I receive is, “Why are there so many brackets?” As...

            Gilt Principal Systems Engineer Jonathan Leibiusky (aka Xetorthio) is amazingly prolific when it comes to releasing useful open source projects&ndash;including Jedis, the popular, easy-to-use Redis Java client. Today Jon released Jedis 2.4.2&ndash;a new version that includes improvements to JedisCluster&rsquo;s connection handling and JedisCluster multi-threading. Check it out!
(In related: Jon is also the co-author (with Chanwit Kaewkasi) of Gedis, a Redis client for Groovy.)

            On Tuesday night Gilt hosted our last evening tech event of the year: the second-ever gathering of the Full-Stack Engineering Meetup. What an amazing turnout! More than 100 software engineers (including 19 Gilt technologists), tech execs, and programming students braved the chilly temps and icy sidewalks to spend a few hours at our 2 Park office eating pizza, chatting about coding, and listening to some great technical presentations. We&rsquo;re super-excited...

            Yesterday Santa Claus stopped by our Park Avenue office to meet with our tech team and ask us about our shipping operations. Seems that Santa has become frustrated with his traditional delivery-by-reindeer approach and wanted some of our expert opinions on how to distribute presents to people faster and with less chafing (from the chimneys, obvs) and false burglary arrests (when chimney entry isn&rsquo;t possible). We were surprised to find...

Today we&rsquo;re feeling grateful for our Culture in Tech team, who organized our first-ever TECH-sgiving last Friday. The lunchtime celebration included an assortment of delicious and sugary pies, cakes, and cupcakes from across the autumn-flavor spectrum. Also spotted: a single salad.

With background fetch, apps that are running in the background—or not even running at all—can wake up periodically to issue server requests and download data.

At Gilt, our toolbox for supporting distributed service development includes Apache ZooKeeper, RabbitMQ, Kafka and a smattering of distributed data stores. We made these technology choices based on years of hands-on development at...

Recently I described my setup at 5@4 (née 5@5&ndash;Gilt Tech&rsquo;s ongoing presentation series, featuring five talks at 4 PM every other Friday) and invited Gilt Tech&rsquo;s photogenic crew, plus our resident dinosaurs, to try...

For those of you couldn&rsquo;t make Gilt co-founder/CTO Michael Bryzek&rsquo;s talk at AppNexus last Wednesday (maybe because you were attending the Play NYC meetup?); click here to view the slides. Bryzek&rsquo;s talk covered Millennials in the workplace, Gilt&rsquo;s social experiment, the value of using key performance indicators (KPIs) and much more. Thanks again to AppNexus for hosting the event.

            When you develop a front end experience for the full screen, the feedback loop between code and test is relatively fast. You code. You refresh your browser. Repeat. When you develop a front end experience for mobile devices, this can become a little cumbersome because the feedback loop can sometimes feel much slower. There are emulators for your machine and browser sizing/user-agent strategies that you can employ to make your...

            Four of us on the Data Engineering team spent the week before Super Storm Sandy at the Teradata Partners conference. It&rsquo;s essentially a massive, week-long, Teradata-sponsored meetup hosting &gt;250 Data Warehouse/Analytics presentations. Both Chris and Deep presented for the first time.

What we&rsquo;ve found is that when MongoDB is happy it runs fast and reliably; but there are a few things that can catch you out. Throttle your writes/updatesMongoDB uses a global write lock.

            In a humanitarian effort to improve developer quality of life, we at Gilt recently stopped supporting Internet Explorer 6. This means we no longer use, develop or test for the browser. Given the small and shrinking population of IE6 users and the auto-upgrades planned for this year, we felt that it is worth our developers&rsquo; happiness (and sanity) to abandon support efforts. Our FEET (Front End Engineering Team) are certainly happy...

            If you’re curious about functional programming, I’d recommend watching Dr. Venkat Subramaniam’s recent talk at Gilt HQ. “Thinking Functionally” provides an insightful and entertaining overview of functional programming techniques and assumes no previous experience in this area.
 Venkat does the whole presentation in TextMate, working through examples in Java, Scala and Groovy.

            In the summer of 2010, our Ops team was tasked with migrating our production systems from one hosting platform to another and immediately began to take stock of the challenges presented by our tools and processes. At Gilt, we make extensive use of both Cobbler and Puppet for our provisioning and configuration management, respectively. Configuration management software like Puppet is awesome, but manually configuring nodes and maintaining the relationships between...

Gilt is unique because our inventory is in constant flux. The products we have one...

Features included using your iPhone’s camera to find products that coordinate with the color of anything you point it at, to umbrella sales that activate when it starts raining near you.

            Templating is a powerful way of separating concerns on the front end. It’s a natural fit for Gilt’s platform, since much of our content comes to the front end from services that return JSON. Sometimes that JSON is rendered in JSPs with JSTL, but sometimes it’s better to render it with JavaScript.

            Few people would argue the importance of great communication across a development organization. It’s vital that developers are aware of the work of their peers&ndash;not only the “what,&ldquo; but also the “how” and “why.&rdquo; Achieving this is easier said than done. Traditional approaches such as wiki documentation, meeting minutes, email lists and chat channels have value, but also have significant drawbacks. We’ve been experimenting with a new approach at Gilt: The...

            While working on TestSwarm, we ran into the problem that none of the JavaScript testing frameworks out there had really solved the problem of how to test asynchronous behavior without requiring the test writer to do something different from how (s)he would test non-asynchronous behavior.

            When you’re developing an iPhone or iPad application, running the app on the device is essential to understanding whether your code is working correctly. Although the iOS Simulator is very useful for testing functionality and user interface interactions, it doesn’t provide a very good simulation of the memory constraints your app will face on actual devices. As a result, applications that run fine in the simulator may be unexpectedly terminated...
