We added an Android team to complement our iOS work; saw our fancy app appear in a Samsung commercial starring Iggy Azalea; relaunched our Gilt Japan iPhone app; and brought home the Webby Award for &ldquo;best iPhone app&rdquo; in the shopping category. We also went to WWDC, delivered mobile-centric tech talks to meetup groups from NYC to Miami to Dublin, and grew our presence in the open source community through the release of projects like Mockingbird Toolbox, Android-Proguard-Snippets, and BlueSteel. We also checked out a lot of great new apps! Here are the team&rsquo;s favorites from 2014: Breather Breather is basically Airbnb for meeting or working space. Need a quiet space to work for a couple of hours? Take advantage of Breather&rsquo;s simple and intuitive user interface and marvel at its high-quality photography. I&rsquo;ve given it a try and the entire process was positive. &ndash;Louis Vera, Senior Software Engineer (Android) Monument Valley I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re tired of hearing people rave about this game, but this is that extremely rare case where the hype is deserved. Everything about Monument Valley is incredible. The visuals are truly unique. Simple shapes are layered, combined with striking colors and smooth animations, to produce complex scenes that are truly a delight to see and interact with. Sound is ambient and unobtrusive, yet crucial to the experience. There is no dialog and so the storyline isn&rsquo;t narrated&ndash;instead, the experience is similar to watching an old silent movie. It&rsquo;s simple and straightforward, yet you&rsquo;ll be sad when it&rsquo;s over. &ndash; Matt Isaacs, Senior Software Engineer (iOS) Skitch Skitch enables you to mark up screenshots easily. A simple enough task, but here&rsquo;s a case where the tiny details make all the difference in the world. I have used Skitch to give directions, communicate with graphic designers, create content for conference presentations, and many other things. A picture (with arrows) is indeed worth a thousand words&ndash;especially when you are typing those words out on a mobile phone. And because Evernote created it, integration with their primary app is fantastic. &ndash;Kevin Schultz, Senior Software Engineer (Android) Emoji++/Swype (iOS) Third-party keyboard support in iOS 8 still feels a bit buggy, but already I&rsquo;ve become hooked on Emoji++ and Swype. Emoji++ makes finding the perfect emoji much easier than the built-in iOS emoji keyboard does. And Swype captures what I&rsquo;m trying to say much faster than the standard keyboard can—not to mention the fact that, by using Swype, I can actually tell when the shift key is engaged! But unless you&rsquo;re prepared for the occasional frustration of keyboards not appearing (which requires force-quitting and relaunching the affected app), you might want to wait until a future version of iOS, and/or future versions of these keyboards, emerge with these kinks sorted out. I can hear my Android friends snickering now&hellip;&ndash;Evan Coyne Maloney, Principal Software Engineer (iOS) UltraVisual I must admit that I get a little lost navigating through UltraVisual: the Brooklyn-born, photo and video creation app acquired by Flipboard in September. I&rsquo;m never quite sure where I am or what I should do next, but that is the whole point to me. I love losing myself in its beautiful imagery and immersive interface. The app provides an endless stream of gorgeousness and inspiration. &ndash;Christopher Gonzalez, Director of Mobile Product Ping From the creators of Secret comes this great push notification-based app, which gives you a steady stream of information about weather, fitspiration, curiosities, daily history and more. It&rsquo;s usually fun and adds a little levity to your day. Ping excels in its simplicity and laser precise focus—no unnecessary bells and whistles.&ndash;Christopher Barr, Senior Interactive Designer Dasher Light and fun, Dasher enables your to message your friends with subtle animations, micro-payments, location coordination, and random gifs for all #things. (The # to animated gif sounds silly, but is actually very fun and quite addicting.) The app made its iOS debut earlier this year, and followed up in November with an Android version that&ndash;as noted in this Medium post by Dasher cofounder Jesse Boyes&ndash;led to a spike in iOS downloads. Interesting. Jesse happens to be Gilt&rsquo;s former Director of Mobile Engineering, and Dasher&rsquo;s other cofounders sharpened their skills at Foursquare and Jetsetter, so we can expect more great work and insightful observations from this team in 2015. &ndash;Louis Vera Cord Cord Project brings voice back into our overtexted lives with the Cord app. Instead of typing out a quick request, wish, or tiding, simply record a 12-second telegram that you can share with as many or as few of your friends as you like. Phonetic spelling, syntactic formatting, and emoticons can only capture and convey so much, while tone, accent, and emphasis speak volumes and come pre-programmed with our speech. Cord&rsquo;s been especially useful to me this winter by helping me to avoid shiver-induced typos and frostbite. On occasion, I reply to messages with soundbites from YouTube (TV and movie quotes just aren’t the same when expressed via text!). &ndash;Randy Gretz, Quality Assurance Analyst TouchRetouch"><meta property="og:description" content="Gilt Mobile had so much to celebrate this year.

href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/gilt+mobile" target="_blank">Gilt Mobile</a> had so much to celebrate this year. We added an Android team to complement our iOS work; saw our <em>fancy</em> app appear in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKPiIlP_Bk8" target="_blank">Samsung commercial starring Iggy Azalea</a>; relaunched our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/08/19/introducing-gilt-japans-all-new-iphone-app" target="_blank">Gilt Japan iPhone app</a>; and brought home the <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/04/28/we-won-the-webby" target="_blank">Webby Award</a> for &ldquo;best iPhone app&rdquo; in the shopping category. We also went to WWDC, delivered mobile-centric tech talks to meetup groups from NYC to Miami to <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/05/22/last-nights-mobile-engineering-at-gilt" target="_blank">Dublin</a>, and grew our presence in the open source community through the release of projects like <a href="https://github.com/gilt/MBToolbox" target="_blank">Mockingbird Toolbox</a>, <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/12/12/new-in-gilt-tech-open-source" target="_blank">Android-Proguard-Snippets</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gilt/BlueSteel" target="_blank">BlueSteel</a>.</p><p>We also checked out a lot of great new apps! Here are the team&rsquo;s favorites from 2014:</p><h3>Breather</h3><p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/ecad5942b26d6cf51962c86221d72756/tumblr_inline_ngqltmyDUY1s17bu5.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://breather.com/" target="_blank">Breather</a> is basically Airbnb for meeting or working space. Need a quiet space to work for a couple of hours? Take advantage of Breather&rsquo;s simple and intuitive user interface and marvel at its high-quality photography. I&rsquo;ve given it a try and the entire process was positive. <em>&ndash;Louis Vera, Senior Software Engineer (Android)</em></p><h3>Monument Valley</h3><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/K2P-YKsHpNs" width="640"></iframe></p><p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re tired of hearing people rave about this game, but this is that extremely rare case where the hype is deserved. Everything about <a href="http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/" target="_blank">Monument Valley</a> is incredible. The visuals are truly unique. Simple shapes are layered, combined with striking colors and smooth animations, to produce complex scenes that are truly a delight to see and interact with. Sound is ambient and unobtrusive, yet crucial to the experience. There is no dialog and so the storyline isn&rsquo;t narrated&ndash;instead, the experience is similar to watching an old silent movie. It&rsquo;s simple and straightforward, yet you&rsquo;ll be sad when it&rsquo;s over. <em>&ndash; <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/matt+isaacs" target="_blank">Matt Isaacs</a>, Senior Software Engineer (iOS)</em></p><h3>Skitch</h3><p><a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/" target="_blank">Skitch</a> enables you to mark up screenshots easily. A simple enough task, but here&rsquo;s a case where the tiny details make all the difference in the world. I have used Skitch to give directions, communicate with graphic designers, create content for conference presentations, and many other things. A picture (with arrows) is indeed worth a thousand words&ndash;especially when you are typing those words out on a mobile phone. And because Evernote created it, integration with their primary app is fantastic. <em>&ndash;<a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/kevin+schultz" target="_blank">Kevin Schultz</a>, Senior Software Engineer (Android)</em></p><h3>Emoji++/Swype (iOS)</h3><p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/5a963c0c587971a3a599acb1deb7ec02/tumblr_inline_ngqn57xvuq1s17bu5.png"></p><p>Third-party keyboard support in iOS 8 still feels a bit buggy, but already I&rsquo;ve become hooked on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emoji++-fast-emoji-keyboard/id919234935?mt=8" target="_blank">Emoji++</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swype/id916365675?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2" target="_blank">Swype</a>. Emoji++ makes finding the perfect emoji much easier than the built-in iOS emoji keyboard does. And Swype captures what I&rsquo;m trying to say much faster than the standard keyboard can—not to mention the fact that, by using Swype, I can actually tell when the shift key is engaged! But unless you&rsquo;re prepared for the occasional frustration of keyboards not appearing (which requires force-quitting and relaunching the affected app), you might want to wait until a future version of iOS, and/or future versions of these keyboards, emerge with these kinks sorted out.

I&rsquo;m never quite sure where I am or what I should do next, but that is the whole point to me. I love losing myself in its beautiful imagery and immersive interface. The app provides an endless stream of gorgeousness and inspiration. <em>&ndash;<a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/christopher+gonzalez" target="_blank">Christopher Gonzalez</a>, Director of Mobile Product</em></p><h3>Ping</h3><p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/3400984a93c0b5796784fc96fc481e32/tumblr_inline_ngqlh8A2bZ1s17bu5.png"></p><p>From the creators of Secret comes this great push notification-based app, which gives you a steady stream of information about weather, fitspiration, curiosities, daily history and more. It&rsquo;s usually fun and adds a little levity to your day. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ping/id922669797?mt=8" target="_blank">Ping</a> excels in its simplicity and laser precise focus—no unnecessary bells and whistles.<em>&ndash;<a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/christopher+barr" target="_blank">Christopher Barr</a>, Senior Interactive Designer<br></em></p><h3>Dasher</h3><p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/a56166d115680656da5515581ef9a28d/tumblr_inline_ngqmyxOv9X1s17bu5.jpg"></p><p>Light and fun, <a href="http://dasher.im/" target="_blank">Dasher</a> enables your to message your friends with subtle animations, micro-payments, location coordination, and random gifs for all #things. (The # to animated gif sounds silly, but is actually very fun and quite addicting.) The app made its iOS debut earlier this year, and followed up in November with an Android version that&ndash;as noted in <a href="https://medium.com/dasher-announcements/unblocking-the-network-effect-d88a33d2532c" target="_blank">this Medium post by Dasher cofounder Jesse Boyes</a>&ndash;led to a spike in iOS downloads. Interesting. Jesse happens to be Gilt&rsquo;s former Director of Mobile Engineering, and Dasher&rsquo;s other cofounders sharpened their skills at Foursquare and Jetsetter, so we can expect more great work and insightful observations from this team in 2015. <em>&ndash;Louis Vera</em></p><h3>Cord</h3><p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/4bb46e90fc0b5bfd36813fedc9e2c353/tumblr_inline_ngqmwcNlLW1s17bu5.png"></p><p>Cord Project brings voice back into our overtexted lives with the <a href="http://cordproject.co/" target="_blank">Cord app</a>. Instead of typing out a quick request, wish, or tiding, simply record a 12-second telegram that you can share with as many or as few of your friends as you like. Phonetic spelling, syntactic formatting, and emoticons can only capture and convey so much, while tone, accent, and emphasis speak volumes and come pre-programmed with our speech. Cord&rsquo;s been especially useful to me this winter by helping me to avoid shiver-induced typos and frostbite. On occasion, I reply to messages with soundbites from YouTube (TV and movie quotes just aren’t the same when expressed via text!). <em>&ndash;Randy Gretz, Quality Assurance Analyst<br></em></p><h3>TouchRetouch</h3><p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/0bfdcf67085040dc6c4237c7317beb42/tumblr_inline_ngqpuu8HvY1s17bu5.png"></p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchretouch/id373311252?mt=8" target="_blank">TouchRetouch</a> is an essential app for editing life-event photos.

But the beautiful visualizations it provides (based on publicly available MTA and U.S. Census data) made me think a little differently about my city. It&rsquo;s an app I can look at for minutes on end, just wondering about the people and metropolis around me.&ndash;<em>Christopher Gonzalez</em></p><h3>1Password</h3><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/88901304" width="640"></iframe></p><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/88901304" target="_blank">1Password - No More Sticky Notes</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/agilebits" target="_blank">AgileBits</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>This year Agile Bits&ndash;creators of the password manager 1Password&ndash;published an official Android version that is well polished, easy to use, and keeps in sync with all the other devices in my life (iPhone, Mac, etc.).
