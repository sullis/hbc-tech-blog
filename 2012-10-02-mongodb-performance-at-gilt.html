MongoDB collections are a really good fit for many of our use cases. What we&rsquo;ve found is that when MongoDB is happy it runs fast and reliably; but there are a few things that can catch you out. Throttle your writes/updatesMongoDB uses a global write lock. Only one process can write at a time, and while writing is happening, nothing can read (items will queue). A very high write load will make read operations very slow. If you need to do data migrations or batch jobs of any kind on your DB, you will need to ensure that the writes happen at a rate of &lt; 50 per second if not using SSD (you can go higher with SSDs). Usually, you&rsquo;ll need to implement some way of prioritizing real-time updates during this process. If you expect a high write load during normal operation, you need to think about sharding. Good capacity planning and loadtesting prior to going live are important. SSDsMongoDB write performance is limited by disk performance, so if lots of writes are going to happen SSDs are a must.Load testingWhile performance testing your service, make sure to use a write load as well as a read-only load, to simulate how your service will perform in production. Manage the length of field namesMongo stores the field name as part of each record. If you pick very long names for your fields your data will be larger than it needs to be. MongoDB only performs well if it can keep working data in memory, so keep field names as short as is reasonable.Use indexesFor any substantial dataset, query performance will suck if you don’t use the right indexes (I have seen it make a difference of about 4 orders of magnitude in response time).
