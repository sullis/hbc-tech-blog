        "excerpt": "Over a year ago we began to experiment with new ways of helping our teams in finding their next improvement opportunities. We started with an assumption that while every team is unique, there must be a way to approach a “team health” conversation in a similar fashion across them all. By using a standardized assessment we also expected to find some areas in which organizational improvements would be beneficial. In our quest for a suitable tool, we borrowed, fine-tuned and iterated to finally arrive at the health checks that fit our needs. This blog post is a reflection on the evolution of team health checks in HBC.",

The study also discovered that by using agile frameworks, organizations can respond to market changes faster, deliver higher quality software, and gain a significant competitive edge. For these reasons HBR has dubbed agile development the competitive advantage for a digital age.Join Jake Brereton, Sr. Brand Manager at Atlassian, as he discusses these HBR findings with Heather Fleming (Sr. Director, PMO, Gilt), Nate Van Dusen (Engineering Program Management Director, Trulia), and Maira Benjamin (Director of Engineering, Pandora); three seasoned agile experts who have successfully lead agile transformations and witnessed tangible, positive results firsthand.In this webinar you&rsquo;ll learn:How Trulia benefited from taking engineering agile principles and spreading them throughout their entire EnterpriseWhat agreements engineering made with Gilt leadership to improve their unique agile development processThe way Pandora&rsquo;s agile approach to implementing agile allowed them to keep what worked and throw out what didn&rsquo;t, quickly ",

        "category": "data science",
        "tags": "analytics Google Trends Data",
        "excerpt": "Google Trends offers a trove of data for analysis. It&rsquo;s not used nearly enough partially because good folks at Google did not provide an API to access the data. You can play with Trends in you browser, embed it into your webpages but it’s not that simple to get the raw data behind it to use it in your analysis.There is a number of packages in Python, Perl, or R that pull the data for you but none of them did when I needed: compare hundreds of trends against each other.You see, not contend with the lack of API Google returns trends on 1 to 100 scale so it’s hard to compare numbers for many different trends. You can plot several trends on the same graph but you will not be able to tell how they stand relative to another set of trends.For example:Above: “Game of Thrones” vs. “House of Cards”.Below: “Orange is New Black” vs. “The Newsroom” Since each set is rescaled there is no way to tell how “House&hellip;” stands against “Orange&hellip;” I needed to get the trends for hundreds of fashion brands Gilt deals with and compare them against each other.The logical solution seemed to use one search term as a baseline in every set and then rescale the results relative to a baseline term.I borrowed heavily from GTrendsR package and came up with a script in R that pulls trends and rescales them relative to baseline.It took some hacking: I took Google Trends export link that looks something likewww.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=/m/06bkdx,+/m/0tlwzvq,+/m/0b6hm_f,+/m/0c5_m3,+/m/0f4w93&amp;geo=US&amp;date=2/2013+25m&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz&amp;tz&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5and after looking at various export options found the one (export=3) that returns raw data in JSON-like string. For example:http://www.google.com/trends/fetchComponent?q=%2Fm%2F06bkdx%2C%2Fm%2F0624dh&amp;date=today%207-d&amp;geo=US&amp;cat=0-18&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=3returns:// Data table responsegoogle.visualization.Query.setResponse({\"version\":\"0.6\",\"status\":\"ok\",\"sig\":\"881376537\",\"table\":{\"cols\":[ {\"id\":\"date\",\"label\":\"Date\",\"type\":\"date\",\"pattern\":\"\"}, {\"id\":\"query0\",\"label\":\"Agent Provocateur\",\"type\":\"number\",\"pattern\":\"\"}, {\"id\":\"query1\",\"label\":\"Kate Spade\",\"type\":\"number\",\"pattern\":\"\"}],\"rows\":[{\"c\":[ {\"v\":new Date(2015,3,18),\"f\":\"Saturday, April 18, 2015\"}, {\"v\":0.0,\"f\":\"0\"},{\"v\":77.0,\"f\":\"77\"}]},{\"c\":[ {\"v\":new Date(2015,3,19),\"f\":\"Sunday, April 19, 2015\"}, {\"v\":0.0,\"f\":\"0\"},{\"v\":100.0,\"f\":\"100\"}]},{\"c\":[ {\"v\":new Date(2015,3,20),\"f\":\"Monday, April 20, 2015\"}, {\"v\":0.0,\"f\":\"0\"}, {\"v\":65.0,\"f\":\"65\"}]},{\"c\":[ {\"v\":new Date(2015,3,21),\"f\":\"Tuesday, April 21, 2015\"}, {\"v\":0.0,\"f\":\"0\"},{\"v\":62.0,\"f\":\"62\"}]},{\"c\":[ {\"v\":new Date(2015,3,22),\"f\":\"Wednesday, April 22, 2015\"}, {\"v\":0.0,\"f\":\"0\"},{\"v\":57.0,\"f\":\"57\"}]},{\"c\":[ {\"v\":new Date(2015,3,23),\"f\":\"Thursday, April 23, 2015\"}, , {\"v\":null}]},{\"c\":[ {\"v\":new Date(2015,3,24),\"f\":\"Friday, April 24, 2015\"}, , {\"v\":null}]}]}});Which is turned into a valid JSON with 4 lines of R code and then parsed into R data structures with rjson package.The result looks like:And can now be analyzed, plotted, and joined with other data.Because of the powers of SQL/MapReduce in our Teradata Aster database we can pull the trends and join with our relational data on the fly in SQL:SELECT *FROM STREAM (       ON (SELECT brand_name from dim_brands)       PARTITION BY brand_name       SCRIPT(&lsquo;GTrends_MR.R&rsquo;)       OUTPUTS('week DATE, term VARCHAR, trend INTEGER&rsquo;))Any comments on Google Trends, R style and overall approach are appreciated.Happy trending!",

        "excerpt": "Last week, Amazon made their Elastic Container Service generally available and also released a web UI to make it easier to create tasks. This service was exciting for our personalization team as we wanted to leverage ECS to simplify deployment of our jobs and have better control over failures.Getting started with ECS is easy but requires your full attention because there are a lot of important details (did you remember to set the correct IAM roles for your container instances?). If you haven’t done so already, make sure you go through the Getting Started documentation.Once you’re ready to run your task what to do if something fails or doesn’t go as planned? Here are some of our experiences debugging ECS tasks.Start with a simple applicationIn our case we created a Scala main method with very few dependencies. A sleep method is sufficient to simulate a job running and should provide enough time to see our container running.Make sure your cluster has at least one container instanceYour ECS cluster requires at least one container instance to run your container. You can check the web console to make sure there is at least one running.If you don’t see your instances here make sure you’ve followed the Container Instance documentation. In particular that you launched an instance with the correct ECS AMI, that you have attached the correct IAM role and that you have pointed your instance to your cluster.Inspect the ECS logsOnce your container instance is attached to your cluster there will be an ecs-agent running on the machine. (note: the ecs-agent is open source and on github so you may be able to find help on the ‘issues’ page if needed ). The ecs-agent emits logs that can help you debug. You will need to ssh to the container instance and inspect the ecs-agent log:/var/log/ecs/ecs-agent.logFor example, when inspecting this log it can be useful to know that the agent has pulled your docker image:t=2015-04-14T15:46:53+0000 lvl=dbug msg=&ldquo;Pulling image&rdquo; module=TaskEngine image=&lt;my-registry.my-domain&gt;.com/&lt;my-image&gt;:latest status=&ldquo;Pulling dependent layers&rdquo;Make sure the container instance installed your docker imageYou can check to make sure the ecs-agent successfully downloaded your docker image. ssh to your container instance and run docker images. Your docker image should appear in this list.If you don’t see your image check the ecs-agent logs and make sure your container instance is able to contact your docker registry by curling the registry and printing out the available tags:curl &rsquo;https://&lt;my-registry.my-domain&gt;.com/v1/repositories/&lt;my-image&gt;/tags&rsquo;Manually start your docker imageChecking to see if your image can be run from the command line is a great way to make sure the image can be run on the container instance. This also gives you an opportunity to inspect the application logs. For example,docker run -it docker-registry.gilt.com/cerebro/svc-cerebro-job:latest bin/cerebro_ngram_job.sh productionCheck for failed container processesIf your container can be run from the command line but is still not being run automatically through ECS Run Task then it’s likely you have something wrong in your ECS Task Definition. Check for failed container processes and inspect their container configuration. To check for failed containers run docker ps -a.Once you have the Container ID you can inspect the docker configuration. If you see an exit code other than 0 there may be an issue with your container configuration. docker inspect &lt;containerId&gt;For example, I noticed an exit code of 127 which indicates a bad command. This led me to fix a bug in the task definition CMD field that requires commands to be passed in json array format.Finally, you can inspect the application log of the container.docker logs &lt;containerId&gt;For reference, here is a working task definition:",

        "author": "Gregory Mazurek",
        "category": "front end",
        "tags": "opensource frontend architecture",
        "excerpt": "At Gilt, our open-source contributions generally come in the form of tools that we use internally that we think have value to the rest of the tech community. But like most other companies, we have internal systems that are very specific to Gilt. This makes open-source contributions tricky because our potential projects and tools are so tightly coupled to our systems. We wanted to bridge this gap and decided to do so through a tiny front end initiative we called Open Source First.For example, our front end architecture consists of over 100 requirejs modules that are bundled and served by an in-house legacy build system that is as tightly coupled as a ball of rubber bands. And, our internal requirements make it necessary that we wrap requirejs which means we oftentimes aren’t using off-the-shelf versions of each module. These modules depend on each other in ways that would make spiders jealous. It works. It’s stable. And once the learning curve is conquered, we defend its design while sipping our orange Kool-Aid. But, it makes open-sourcing any of these individual modules just about impossible.The Special Operations team (Kyle Dorman, Jose Sanchez, Archana Kumar, and myself) set out to create a pattern by which we could open-source modules that could be used by the greater tech community without sacrificing any characteristics of the module had it been developed internally. We used a project that we had just finished called OAFE (Open App From Email) as the basis of this experiment. OAFE is one of those mobile-web user experiences you see that asks “if you’d like to install the app.” Internally, we have a lot of discourse about whether this is a good experience for our users or not. As a result, our implementation of OAFE is a little complex. It tries to be the best experience for people who want to be redirected and people who want to stay on the mobile web. OAFE was a perfect candidate for an open source project because it needed to be implemented on two completely separate code basis (Gilt and Gilt City).We created UBAR (Unidirectional Browser App Resolver) as an open-source first module that behaved as OAFE. Our goal was to write a front-end module that could be easily consumed both by our current system and externally. We did so without sacrificing any internal requirements or features. Are we expecting that other people are going to use UBAR on their websites? Frankly, no. So, why go through this exercise of creating open-source modules? This is where the learnings happened that ultimately forced us to think better and harder about our work.5 Key LearningsPRIDE Your code being publicly available instills a sense of pride. This is our work. This what we are capable of doing. This is how we do it. We want it to be great because we want others in the tech industry to appreciate it. As a result, we are quick to make fixes to bugs and quick to make improvements to make it feel better. Since it’s something we want to be proud of, we all felt an energy of wanting it to be great. It has been a great team-building exercise.GIVING BACK We shared our creative process for implementing an open-source module so that we could inspire others to do the same. For so long, we have taken from the front-end community without giving back substantially. This is our attempt to give back, just a little. It feels good.CODE LEGACY Regardless what happens with the feature, the engineers on the team have a really cool sense of pride for their work. The hard part about working on websites is that features are pulled down as frequently as they’re put up. This is our way of giving some legacy to the code.WORKFLOW In the chance someone wants to use our open-source module, they can contribute to it. This allows input on our work from sources that we don’t necessarily interact with on a daily basis. One of our team members left the company during the development of the feature but since it was open-source, she was able to continue tracking its progress.BETTER ARCHITECTURE Open-source first completely reshaped the way we thought about architecting this module, for the better. We did not want to remove any characteristics or attributes of the module from the open-source project. We wanted to eat our own dogfood. As a result, we thought a lot about how this module could be consumed by systems that were not our own. We created a patterns for how external users could easily implement tracking analytics, template rendering, deep-link requirements, and design. Through these abstractions, our code is easier to read and less tightly coupled than other comparable modules that we created.Gilt was fully supportive of this effort largely due to the culture set forth by our technical leadership. And, that really moves us to our last point: this made us really excited about our work. It made us bond well as a team. It made us feel like we were making positive contributions to Gilt, to ourselves, to each other, and to the tech community. It felt like good technical culture.And since we created patterns and frameworks, it’s a technical culture that we can share both internally and externally. Going forward, we’re going to try to open-source everything, first.To view UBAR’s source code, please click here.To read more about UBAR and to see it on a mobile device, please click here.",

I took the opportunity to build on earlier work from Yoni Goldberg and my colleagues in Dublin on how Gilt has adopted micro-services in the last two years: the micro-services architecture and philosophy has solved some hard problems for us, but has created new and fun challenges and it was great to share with the community at large. NearForm’s CTO Richard Rodger borrowed some ideas Leslie Lamport on how best to monitor the inherent distributed complexity of micro-services architectures by seeking and monitoring the invariants in the system - this resonates hugely with what we’re doing with the soon-to-be-open-sourced CAVE project. His talk is minimal, fun and way, way smarter than mine and you should definitely look him up. Finally, it was a huge pleasure to meet up with Fred George, a veteran industry player and speaker, who fleshed out some of the key attributes and challenges of micro-services architectures, advocating a strong preference for asynchronous services and a strong 1:1 ownership of services and their data stores. Beguiled by tales of 14-line services, I have a strong hankering to go learn some Clojure now :). All slides from the show will be up shortly on the Microservices Dublin website; in the meantime, I’m including a link to mine below.

        "excerpt": "Image via H. Michael Karshis. When implementing &ldquo;lazy val&rdquo; class variables in Scala 2.10, keep in mind that lazy vals hide some plain-old synchronized block behind a nice-looking syntax. At Gilt, more and more of our stuff is Future-based, and increasingly more of it executes in Scala&rsquo;s shared ForkJoinPool under the assumption that it &ldquo;behaves.&rdquo; Sometimes these worlds collide, however, and &ldquo;lazy val&rdquo;-guarded calls (which are synchronized blocks in disguise) end up being thrown into global FJP. And worse, they may some times be highly-contended.There are good reasons to use Futures and async IO, and good reasons to use lazy vals. You just need to be very, very careful if and when you end up mixing the two, because they are a bit tricky to understand at best and may lock up your system at worst. Of course, the easy position to take is, &ldquo; just don&rsquo;t do it! &rdquo;:)  The rule of thumb: If code that initializes your lazy val is non-blocking and very fast, it&rsquo;s most likely OK and could be good way to defer creation of heavy objects (like thread pools). OTOH, if your lazy val is initialized from a Future, or the result of some remote service call(s), that can easily turn out to be problematic when &lsquo;normal&rsquo; code that tries to de-reference those values ends up (unwittingly) making a blocking call inside a (perhaps shared) FJP. Think twice if that&rsquo;s where you find yourself&ndash;there are often better alternatives. &ndash;Content (and most words) by Andrey Kartashov, Gilt Principal Software Engineer",

        "title": "An Open Source AWS Leader Election Library Built in Akka",
        "date": "JAN 7 2015",
        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",
        "tags": "akka aws ec2",
        "excerpt": "Recently I needed a scheduled job inside one of my distributed services: an open-source Play application with at least two instances running on EC2, using an auto-scaling group to spin up new instances as needed. I needed to send reminder emails to a subset of the team management services’ users every ‘x’ amount of days. The solution that best suited my needs in this situation was a leader-elected task. In the past, I’ve used ZooKeeper to schedule a leader-elected task. Gilt had helper classes, which made this a breeze. But I didn’t want to set up a ZooKeeper cluster in AWS just for a small, non-critical service, so I needed something simple and lightweight. A fairly standard setup for engineers who design distributed services is to have multiple instances of a service in an AWS auto-scaling group, so I decided to create my own leader election library and open-source whatever I ended up building. Introducing aws-leader-election: a Scala and akka-cluster based PnP leader election library for use in AWS.aws-leader-election is built on Akka and uses akka-cluster’s cluster singleton to perform leader-elected tasks. It also uses AWS&rsquo;s auto-scaling Java client to discover EC2 instances and creates an Akka cluster from the auto-scaling group members. Creating aws-leader-electionThe first challenge in creating this project involved instance/node discovery. Using an autoscaling group made this relatively easy. The AWS Java SDK client gave me access to ask the auto-scaling group for its list of currently running instances. At this point I found some terrific work by Chris Loy, who set up an Akka cluster in EC2 using an auto-scaling group. This gave me a great starting point. I was able to ask my auto-scaling group for its list of currently running instances and use them as seed nodes for an Akka cluster. This is where I ran into my first issue. My Play service is built using the sbt-native-packager plugin and Gilt Senior Software Engineer Gary Coady’s Docker addition to native-packager (which allows you to build a Docker image and release it to the Docker repository). I then use an in-house script called ionblaster to automate a new AWS stack creation and deploy my Docker image in each EC2 instance. My issue was with Docker’s internal network stack vs. the host’s network stack, and the IP address Akka was binding to. To solve this, I had to force Docker to use the host EC2 instance’s network stack by providing the `&ndash;net=host` parameter to Docker. This would be an issue if we wanted to run multiple Docker containers on a single EC2 instance.With this solved, I was free to move onto having my instances arrive at a consensus regarding which one is the leader. For this I took a look at the Raft algorithm for consensus. There were already libraries out there that performed Raft on top of an Akka cluster. I eventually decided that Raft was overkill just to perform the same level of leader election that Akka already provides. The Akka cluster singleton actor served my purposes more than adequately. By taking this approach, I had to accept that certain problems might arise; the potential drawbacks are documented in the Akka documentation quite explicitly. For my specific case, these potential drawbacks were all acceptable. I included some of the ZooKeeper leader-elected job helper classes to make things even simpler. I also wrote a few multi-jvm unit tests, which are serving my purpose perfectly; hopefully they will be useful for you, too.A question you might askIf there are so few guarantees in this implementation, then wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to simply create an AutoScalingGroup of exactly one node, with a health check, so that it bounces it if something gets stuck?That&rsquo;s one way to do it. But this approach wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed me to play with akka-cluster :P. And would have meant a more hands-on approach than, &ldquo;I want three instances of this service, make it happen,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;d much prefer.akka-cluster handles nodes going down/leaving and coming back up/joining. And it&rsquo;s a lot quicker then a bouncing instance, meaning that there&rsquo;s less time in the no-leader zone.Next StepsWhile aws-leader-election fulfills its primary objective of a simple and lightweight leader election library for scheduling tasks, any contributions are more than welcome.

        "tags": "Gilt Gilt Groupe Gilt Tech",
        "excerpt": "The Gilt engineering team has been transitioning to the latest version of our in-house library&ndash;a move that involves migrating from Guava ListenableFutures to Scala Futures. Futures are a key building block of reactive applications, and offer a really nice API for writing fast, efficient, non-blocking code. However, using them requires some skills that are a bit outside the scope of “traditional” programming. For all of you who are new to Scala, or not-so-new but unfamiliar with futures, I thought it was worth sharing some thoughts on important things to watch out for when working with them.Your code should be non-blockingThe easy .get() option, which is available on ListenableFuture, is not available on Scala Future. Instead, you are required to use the deliberately less elegant Await API. This is actually a good thing, as it gives you plenty of time to reconsider the fact that you’re blocking, while you’re typing it out :) Blocking is strongly discouraged, as it defeats the whole purpose of futures&ndash;and there is almost always a better, more efficient way to write the code in a non-blocking way.Having said all that, there may be times when you have no choice but to block. If you find yourself in this situation, you need to think carefully about which threads you are holding onto while you are blocking. For example, if you’re writing a Play application and decide to block the main request thread, then your application will very quickly run out of threads, and throughput will slow to a trickle. This is because the thread you are blocking on is from a very small thread pool that Play makes available for handling incoming requests.One case where blocking may be acceptable, or even desired, is a background thread&ndash;perhaps one that is refreshing a cache. In this case, you can create a fixed-size thread pool for handling the cache refresh and block on this. Since the use of the thread pool is isolated, there is no harm holding onto threads while you wait for a Future to resolve.Which execution context you use mattersMore and more APIs require an execution context to be passed either implicitly or explicitly. For example, the Scala Future.onComplete function is defined as:def onComplete[U](f: Try[T] =&gt; U)(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): UnitThe callback function (f) is executed on a thread from the passed-in execution context. It&rsquo;s very important to consider what type of operations are executed in f.For CPU-bound (i.e. non-blocking) operations, you can follow the guidance of the Scala compiler error that you get when you forget to provide the context&ndash;namely, importing scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global. Alternatively, it may be desirable to use a &ldquo;same thread&rdquo; execution context.&ndash;i.e., the callback executes on the same thread that completes the Future, rather than forcing a hand-off to another thread.For I/O-bound (i.e. blocking) operations, you should consider providing a different context. The global context by default has only N threads, where N is the number of processors available to the JVM. If you call Await.result on one of the global execution context threads, it will create another thread to compensate. (Its main goal in life is to keep the CPU busy&ndash;check out this post for more info.) However, if you’re doing a lot of blocking it’s better to create your own context with an appropriately-sized Executor and leave the global context available to everybody else for what it was intended for&ndash;small CPU-bound tasks.What happens if a Future fails?Futures will fail for a variety of reasons: timeouts calling a service, deserialization exceptions, etc. You need to think about what the behaviour should be when this happens. For comprehensions and the operators map, flatMap and foreach may be nice to use, but they can also lull you into a false sense of security. And since Scala doesn’t have checked exceptions, you won’t get any help from the compiler. Somebody is going to have to deal with the exception at some point. Luckily a Scala Future has really nice APIs like .recover, .recoverWith and .onFailure for handling exceptions and providing fallback behavior.Futures are a really powerful tool for building fast, efficient, non-blocking applications. The APIs are elegant and simple to use. However, behind the simple APIs lies a world of complexity. It’s important to think carefully about how you are using futures and get a good understanding of the basic concepts behind them.",

Every day I learned something new or developed a new skill.Lucky for us, Samantha was able to come back to Gilt for a few wintry weeks and intern some more&ndash;she&rsquo;ll be with us through the end of January 2015. If you&rsquo;d like to be a Gilt software engineering intern in summer 2015, go here to apply.The Plasma PrixOur tech teams in NYC and Dublin spent much of February learning how to drive PlasmaCars: small plastic cars usually steered by children, but hearty enough to accommodate a (svelte) 6’8” Gilt technologist. When we all got together for our Architecture Summit in NYC, we held the Plasma Prix: a race pitting the top ten-fastest PlasmaCar racers against each other in a bid for fame, glory, and trophies. Relive the magic by watching our movie about it. We Had Non-Vehicular Fun, TooGame night!Fancy Cheese Fridays (and Cheese-mageddons)! OKTA-bierfest! Gregorween! Gregorbier! Encrypting!NYCity-wide trivia victories!Zumo robot-making with the kids from Bronx Academy of Software Engineering!HipFoosball!White after Labor Day!Paper airplane contests!Wine, cheese, and filmmakers!Mini-offsites!Bagel brunching!Horse adoption!These are just some of the fun things we were all about in 2014. The Gilt Design Team Joins TechMaking sure that we’re as bold and innovative as possible about driving user engagement is one of our goals. With this in mind, we decided this summer to more tightly align our Web Design and User Experience teams&ndash;allowing for closer collaboration between UX, design, product, and front-end developers. With this unification we’ve generated greater momentum around strategic initiatives and evolving the customer experience.",

        "excerpt": "Not to be outdone by the Gilt Mobile team, the Gilt Personalization team also found time to share some of their favorite tools, tips and talks in this space. Read on (and check out their 2013 faves here):Spark 1.0In 2013 we listed the open source cluster-computing engine Spark as a great tool for getting started with parallel processing. This year, Spark reached version 1.0. With this major release, the developers behind Spark also bundled MLib in with the core framework&ndash;providing machine learning algorithms out of the box and making the linear regression algorithm easier to run than ever. Other Spark 1.0 algorithms that Gilt’s tech team uses are PCA (for pre-processing the data), collaborative filtering (for brand recommendations) and KMeans clustering (to segment our audience). Although there are still some rough spots&ndash;for example, PCA is still not fully parallelized&ndash;this release is a big step towards making scalable machine learning accessible for all. &ndash; Scott Thompson, Software EngineerFacial recognitionComputer vision keeps getting better at facial and image recognition, and the most recent incremental improvements have finally pushed the machines above their main competitor&ndash;humans. A number of approaches now show that level of performance; GaussianFace, which is based on a Discriminative Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, caught my eye earlier this year, and DeepID2+&ndash;released just this month&ndash;advanced the top of the leaderboard. From a different perspective, Google “solved” its own recaptcha task and is now moving away from recognizing numbers in signs toward comparing images in different contexts&ndash;something it’s also hoping to improve from an algorithmic perspective. Although humans remain far superior at answering questions around storytelling based on images, expect recognition of more complex contexts to be the next frontier. &ndash; Zachary Cohn, Machine Learning SpecialistMachine Learning as a ServiceMachine learning as a service has seen a lot of growth, with several major tech players deciding to invest in this work and gain additional value from the products that they have developed in-house. Google&rsquo;s Prediction API, IBM’s Watson, and Microsoft Azure ML have all made significant updates to their offerings this year&ndash;joining an already-crowded field of smaller providers hoping to capitalize on the growing democratization of “big data” platforms. More and more companies are finding themselves sitting on troves of data that they have no idea what to do with; why not experiment? How far these tools can go without having an expert to guide them remains to be seen&ndash;but as software and algorithms improve, much of what is hand-crafted today will be automated tomorrow. &ndash; Zachary CohnMachine Learning + Online Learning = Easy LearningThe number of online resources that will help you acquire knowledge and skills related to machine learning and big data continues to grow. On Coursera, you can enroll in free intro to machine learning classes taught by Coursera cofounder/Stanford professor Andrew Ng or University of Washington professor Pedro Domingos; learn R, data analysis, and other relevant topics through Johns Hopkins University’s 10 different courses; master data mining and analysis through the University of Illinois’ track, and more (new classes are posted all the time). Other online resources include Udacity’s affordable machine learning course with Stanford prof/Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun; DataCamp’s data analyst classes; Stanford’s free CS 229 Machine Learning course; and the seemingly endless number of informative articles, slideshows, and recorded talks you can find just by conducting a simple Google search. Mix and match and see what you learn. &ndash; Lauri Apple, Tech EvangelistEvangelizing Machine Learning at GiltGilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer kicked things off in this vein in January by presenting a talk for NYC Machine Learning&ndash;the huge machine learning-oriented meetup group co-organized by InfluxDB CEO Paul Dix and Palantir engineer Max Kesin. In May, Lead Software Engineer Will Chiong presented a talk for the Full-Stack Engineering meetup on how we analyze customer behavior data to make recommendations. In August, Gilt Tech’s Dublin team hosted a free Machine Learning course taught by University College Dublin professor/expert Padraig Cunningham. We also expanded our personalization team by several members&ndash;adding our first machine learning specialist and several engineers. &ndash; Lauri AppleSpotify&rsquo;s &ldquo;Top Tracks in Your Network&rdquo;",

        "excerpt": "Over the next few days we&rsquo;ll be recapping some of the #gilttech team&rsquo;s favorite and most significant tech developments of 2014. To kick things off, here are some of the highlights of our engineering work this year.We Upped Our Commitment to Open SourceAt our Architecture Summit in February, our engineering team coalesced around the goals of incorporating more open source tools into our work and increasing our contributions to the OS community. Since then we’ve added dozens of new projects to our team GitHub page (you’ll learn about several of them in more detail below), revised our OS guidelines to simplify the release process for our engineers, and formed a working group to strengthen our OS culture internally. Several of our team’s OS projects&ndash;Android-Proguard-Snippets, Mockingbird (iOS), and sbt-dependency-graph-sugar (Scala)&ndash;have generated lots of excitement in their respective communities, which we appreciate.apidocBuilt by the Gilt engineering team, apidoc is a lovingly crafted open source project that enables you to build beautiful documentation for REST services. With apidoc, you can download native client libraries with no (or almost no) dependencies. Its intuitive JSON format is easy to navigate, which makes it fun to use. Check out the apidoc to-do list and contribute to this project, which you’ll hear more about in 2015.AWS at GiltThis year we started using AWS in order to reduce the effort spent managing physical hardware. Now our engineers can get a server with a simple click of a button. AWS aligns with our goal to make software engineering as simple, scalable and empowering as possible. “AWS enabled me to set up a fault-tolerant Elasticsearch cluster in a single afternoon,” says Senior Software Engineer Anthony Manfredi.CAVE Begun in earnest this year, CAVE stands for &ldquo;continuous audit vault enterprise.&rdquo; Not sure what that means? Here&rsquo;s another description: CAVE is an open-source managed service for monitoring infrastructure, platform, and application metrics. Largely the work of Gilt Senior Software Engineer Val Dumitrescu and Software Engineer Pawel Raszewski, and built in Scala, CAVE combines InfluxDB, Kinesis, Amazon RDS, and other great technologies to provide visibility into your system’s performance and operational levels. Learn more about it by reviewing the above slideshow.Gilt’s Custom A/B Testing PlatformA/B testing is core to Gilt’s product development methodology. It informs our decision-making and gives us insight into what’s working and what’s not. The A/B testing system we used to use wasn’t able to scale as we grew&ndash;it essentially limited our platform to 64 test variants max. This created a situation in which we began to work on way more products than that platform could handle. To remedy this, Gilt Lead Software Engineer Young Moon and VP of Personalization Erik Lumer worked together to build a completely new platform that allows for a nearly limitless number of concurrent tests for our product development purposes.

        "excerpt": "Gilt Mobile had so much to celebrate this year. We added an Android team to complement our iOS work; saw our fancy app appear in a Samsung commercial starring Iggy Azalea; relaunched our Gilt Japan iPhone app; and brought home the Webby Award for &ldquo;best iPhone app&rdquo; in the shopping category. We also went to WWDC, delivered mobile-centric tech talks to meetup groups from NYC to Miami to Dublin, and grew our presence in the open source community through the release of projects like Mockingbird Toolbox, Android-Proguard-Snippets, and BlueSteel.We also checked out a lot of great new apps! Here are the team&rsquo;s favorites from 2014:BreatherBreather is basically Airbnb for meeting or working space. Need a quiet space to work for a couple of hours? Take advantage of Breather&rsquo;s simple and intuitive user interface and marvel at its high-quality photography. I&rsquo;ve given it a try and the entire process was positive. &ndash;Louis Vera, Senior Software Engineer (Android)Monument ValleyI&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re tired of hearing people rave about this game, but this is that extremely rare case where the hype is deserved. Everything about Monument Valley is incredible. The visuals are truly unique. Simple shapes are layered, combined with striking colors and smooth animations, to produce complex scenes that are truly a delight to see and interact with. Sound is ambient and unobtrusive, yet crucial to the experience. There is no dialog and so the storyline isn&rsquo;t narrated&ndash;instead, the experience is similar to watching an old silent movie. It&rsquo;s simple and straightforward, yet you&rsquo;ll be sad when it&rsquo;s over. &ndash; Matt Isaacs, Senior Software Engineer (iOS)SkitchSkitch enables you to mark up screenshots easily. A simple enough task, but here&rsquo;s a case where the tiny details make all the difference in the world. I have used Skitch to give directions, communicate with graphic designers, create content for conference presentations, and many other things. A picture (with arrows) is indeed worth a thousand words&ndash;especially when you are typing those words out on a mobile phone. And because Evernote created it, integration with their primary app is fantastic. &ndash;Kevin Schultz, Senior Software Engineer (Android)Emoji++/Swype (iOS)Third-party keyboard support in iOS 8 still feels a bit buggy, but already I&rsquo;ve become hooked on Emoji++ and Swype. Emoji++ makes finding the perfect emoji much easier than the built-in iOS emoji keyboard does. And Swype captures what I&rsquo;m trying to say much faster than the standard keyboard can—not to mention the fact that, by using Swype, I can actually tell when the shift key is engaged! But unless you&rsquo;re prepared for the occasional frustration of keyboards not appearing (which requires force-quitting and relaunching the affected app), you might want to wait until a future version of iOS, and/or future versions of these keyboards, emerge with these kinks sorted out. I can hear my Android friends snickering now&hellip;&ndash;Evan Coyne Maloney, Principal Software Engineer (iOS)UltraVisualI must admit that I get a little lost navigating through UltraVisual: the Brooklyn-born, photo and video creation app acquired by Flipboard in September. I&rsquo;m never quite sure where I am or what I should do next, but that is the whole point to me. I love losing myself in its beautiful imagery and immersive interface. The app provides an endless stream of gorgeousness and inspiration. &ndash;Christopher Gonzalez, Director of Mobile ProductPingFrom the creators of Secret comes this great push notification-based app, which gives you a steady stream of information about weather, fitspiration, curiosities, daily history and more. It&rsquo;s usually fun and adds a little levity to your day. Ping excels in its simplicity and laser precise focus—no unnecessary bells and whistles.&ndash;Christopher Barr, Senior Interactive DesignerDasherLight and fun, Dasher enables your to message your friends with subtle animations, micro-payments, location coordination, and random gifs for all #things. (The # to animated gif sounds silly, but is actually very fun and quite addicting.) The app made its iOS debut earlier this year, and followed up in November with an Android version that&ndash;as noted in this Medium post by Dasher cofounder Jesse Boyes&ndash;led to a spike in iOS downloads. Interesting. Jesse happens to be Gilt&rsquo;s former Director of Mobile Engineering, and Dasher&rsquo;s other cofounders sharpened their skills at Foursquare and Jetsetter, so we can expect more great work and insightful observations from this team in 2015. &ndash;Louis VeraCordCord Project brings voice back into our overtexted lives with the Cord app. Instead of typing out a quick request, wish, or tiding, simply record a 12-second telegram that you can share with as many or as few of your friends as you like. Phonetic spelling, syntactic formatting, and emoticons can only capture and convey so much, while tone, accent, and emphasis speak volumes and come pre-programmed with our speech. Cord&rsquo;s been especially useful to me this winter by helping me to avoid shiver-induced typos and frostbite. On occasion, I reply to messages with soundbites from YouTube (TV and movie quotes just aren’t the same when expressed via text!). &ndash;Randy Gretz, Quality Assurance AnalystTouchRetouch",

        "excerpt": "Written by Vivian Peng, Columbia University graduate (Public Health Informatics, 2014), professional designer and data science trainerA year ago, &ldquo;R&rdquo; meant no more to me than any other letter of the English alphabet. Today, it represents the door that has opened a host of opportunities and a newly discovered passion into the data science world.For those of you who are not familiar with R, it is an open-source programming language that’s widely used by statisticians and data scientists to explore data sets and conduct analyses. I first stumbled into R last fall, when I signed up for the Intro to Data Science course at Columbia University. As a second-year grad student at Columbia&rsquo;s Mailman School of Public Health, I was lured in by all of the buzz about data science and interested in learning &ldquo;enough about programming to be able to speak to developers.&rdquo;On the first day of lab, I received an email stating that our session was rescheduled to the following day because our professor had a scheduling conflict with the New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup. This presented a scheduling conflict for me—I had to work that day. Furious about having to miss my first Data Science session, I Googled our professor, Jared Lander, to see what his deal was.Not only did I learn that Jared the organizer of the aforementioned meetup, but that he’s also the author of R for Everyone, a corporate trainer of R and data science, and the founder of his own consulting business. In conducting my Google search, I discovered that he was teaching a free, day-long R course at Gilt the next week, and immediately signed up to attend. In my application, I candidly wrote, &ldquo;Jared is my professor, and I really need help on my homework.&quot; In retrospect, I am incredibly grateful to Gilt for accepting me to the course for a couple of reasons. First, it saved my sanity that week, as I felt more prepared and better equipped to complete the assignment I was working on at the time. And most importantly, it was the first time I realized that I really enjoy coding. Little did I know that, one year out, I&rsquo;d still be coding&ndash;and passionately helping others to code as well.  Since taking Gilt’s R class, I&rsquo;ve continued to pursue my ambitions in data science by building data visualizations that raise awareness of public health issues. And just this week, I got the opportunity to assist Jared in his training course at a big investment-banking firm in NYC. It&rsquo;s funny how life comes full-circle, and how the frustrations of our present can pave the way for possibilities in our futures.Thank you Gilt and Jared Lander for setting me on this path!Have you attended one of our free Gilt courses&ndash;and has it helped your career or started you on an unexpected path?

        "excerpt": "Client-side web application monitoring comes in two main flavors. Real User Monitoring, or RUM, uses an agent that runs within each web page and reports on the page load data for every request. Typically, the browser’s performance timing API data is used. Gilt uses New Relic for RUM, and it provides a good overview of the application ecosystem. In the old forest/tree metaphor, it’s the forest.Synthetic monitoring does not run in the web application. Rather, synthetic monitoring vendors provide remote hardware that hits a web site periodically, and stores data for what it sees on that particular request. It’s “synthetic” because it’s not your users’ data; requests are made specifically for collecting data on your page loads. But it’s also controlled. The requests are made from predictable hardware over predictable connections. If RUM is the forest, synthetic monitoring is the trees.Gilt has been using Rigor for synthetic monitoring. It’s interesting to see how the data from each kind of monitoring provides a different perspective on the health of an application.Different PerspectivesRUM collects data on every web request from every customer. So it’s big data, and our view of that data is going to be broad and not deep. For example, average page load times include every hit to the page, cached requests and uncached requests. These averages make it more difficult to see performance problems when they happen. The following is the performance of our sale listing page for a month in New Relic:Unlike RUM, synthetic monitoring is always dealing with a single uncached request from consistent hardware. This makes it much easier to see when a change affects performance. The following is a single request to the same sale listing page, for the same time period.Looks different, doesn’t it? There are obvious spikes and valleys. When we layer the two images on top of each other, we see that one really significant spike in the synthetic chart doesn’t even register on the RUM chart:So which type of monitoring should we use? The answer is YES. Both RUM and synthetic monitoring give different views of our performance, and are useful for different things. RUM helps us understand long-term trends, and synthetic monitoring helps us diagnose and solve shorter-term performance problems.Case StudyAround October 1, I noticed an uptick in our sale listing page load time in Rigor. Incidentally, this is the same spike that above didn&rsquo;t really show up on the New Relic RUM chart.Looking through the git log of the repo, I didn’t see anything too suspicious. I then isolated the deployed git tag in which the change happened and performed a diff between that tag and the previous tag, comparing their frozen package.json files (containing the fully resolved AMD module versions). That showed a couple of possibilities, so I started looking into Rigor’s data.Synthetic monitoring tools generally give access to the waterfall charts for every page load. So, I isolated a few waterfalls prior to the uptick and a few following the uptick. What I found: an additional 25 images and a couple of additional requests. I was pretty sure I had my smoking gun.The culprit was most likely a new AMD module, called component.trending_products. Its job is to request products that our customers are currently buying in real time. This is a great feature for our customers, but at this point seemed to be adding upwards of a second of load time to our pages.Confirming the SuspicionFortunately, synthetic monitoring is very good at showing us data around things even if customers are not seeing them. I was able to create an A/B test using our configuration service and use it to disable the feature for any visitor with a certain query parameter. This allowed me to run a synthetic test for a few days, which made it very clear this new feature was the problem. You can see that the lines move parallel to each other, with the only slight exception indicating a load time outlier that affected the average and 90%/95%/99% lines.Solving the ProblemFortunately, issues like these are relatively simple to improve.The first problem is the number of images. The component fetches JSON data from a service endpoint, runs it through a Handlebars template, and injects the resulting HTML into the page. The data source can contain any number of products to show to the user; typically around 25-30. But the product images are displayed in a carousel:As much as we’d like to tell ourselves otherwise, most users are not going to advance the carousel to look at additional products, so there’s really no need to load the image data for the images that are off-screen. This is easily accomplished with a template like this:&lt;img data-gilt-src=\"/path/to/image\" /&gt;This way, the image URI is in the rendered HTML. Of course, since none of the images have src attributes, I didn’t have any images showing on page load. The next step: activate the visible ones immediately after the template renders and is injected. (In the code below, the pageSize variable was created using window.matchMedia and was equal to the number of carousel items showing at each screen resolution.)target.find('img[data-gilt-src]').each(function (i) {  if (i &lt; pageSize) {    $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('data-gilt-src'));    $(this).removeAttr('data-gilt-src');  }});The images also were missing their quality parameter. We use a service provided by our CDN to compress our JPGs slightly, which saves roughly 30% on the file transfer. Adding ?oq=85 to the image immediately reduces the bandwidth going over the wire.Finally, I just needed a little bit of JavaScript to load additional images when the user interacts with the carousel. I was able to use our carousel’s API to do this (element is already in scope as the carousel container):carousel.subscribe('elementSwitched', function (data) {  element.find('img[data-gilt-src]').each(function (i) {    $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('data-gilt-src'));    $(this).removeAttr('data-gilt-src');  });}Loading all of the images at this point makes sense no matter how many carousel pages there are. By the time the user is interacting with the carousel, it’s a fairly safe assumption that the page is done loading and that there isn&rsquo;t too much other HTTP traffic.All these changes can&rsquo;t eliminate the load time involved in adding a new feature to a page. However, you can certainly tell from the chart below when the fixes were released, which is a continuation of the earlier chart showing just the A/B test variants. The decrease of all load times is actually unrelated; it&rsquo;s the coming together of the two lines, with and without the trending products feature, that shows the improvement.As time has passed, this new feature has settled into adding about 150ms to the page load, which is reasonable for the additional customer benefit it provides.Synthetic monitoring provides a perspective on your application that RUM can&rsquo;t. The controlled environment makes problems more visible, and also gives you the opportunity to test your hypotheses and make corrections without requiring customer traffic. This case study confirmed for us the usefulness of synthetic monitoring, and we&rsquo;re excited to integrate the tool into our workflow more in the future, including testing the performance of new features before we send customer traffic to them.",

        "excerpt": "It’s no secret that China is an enormous market with significant potential for luxury retailers. It’s also no secret that operating in China is a riskier and more complex endeavor than operating in traditional western markets, which is why many retailers&ndash;including Nieman Marcus and eBay&ndash;haven’t fully figured out how to truly compete there yet. Taking a nuanced, intentional, and planned approach to entering China is essential. It is with such intentionality that Gilt approaches our recent relaunch into China.We&rsquo;re excited to announce today a significant set of new products and features for our Chinese customers in preparation for November 11th&ndash;otherwise known as Singles&rsquo; Day, or &ldquo;1111.&rdquo;Success in China is highly dependent on relationships&ndash;关系, pronounced &ldquo;Guānxì&rdquo;&ndash;and, as such, our recent launch was done in close alignment with our friends at Alipay, Alimama, and UnionPay. Our relationships have allowed us to make Gilt known and accessible to our Chinese customers in ways that surprise and delight (as seen on our Gilt Weibo account), and at a level that many other western retailers have yet to achieve. We’re thankful for and excited about these partnerships, and hope to build even more relationships as we further expand into China.Our excitement and partnership is well encompassed in this quote in Jing Daily by Jingming Li, President of Alipay US:“As China’s most widely used e-payment service provider, Alipay focuses on enabling commerce between global brands and Chinese consumers,” states Jingming Li, the president and chief architect of Alipay United States. “We are excited to partner with Gilt to help connect our consumers with the products and brands they desire. China’s e-commerce market could be worth as much as $650 billion in 2020,  and we see this as a great opportunity for global sites, like Gilt, that offer top-quality products and a premium shopping experience.”How did we approach our China relaunch? And what should other companies keep in mind as they consider international expansion plans, and the nuances in those markets? In an attempt to answer these questions, I&rsquo;ll discuss a few key topics:Why China? Examining the market opportunity for GiltGilt in China todayOptimizing for the Chinese customer experienceWhat’s next?1. Why China? Examining the Market Opportunity for GiltEvaluating the market opportunity is always an essential step in any major geographic expansion. Prior to making this investment for Gilt, we had to understand whether we could be positioned to succeed. Key questions we asked:How large is the luxury goods market in China? Is it growing?What are customer expectations in China? How do they differ from what we currently offer?What is Gilt’s current position in the market? What are competitors doing?How must we alter Gilt&rsquo;s customer experience to best serve the Chinese audience?The Chinese Luxury Goods Market: China&rsquo;s GDP is $8.3 trillion, and is growing at 7.4% per year. Ecommerce represents 5.5% of its total GDP. A portion of that is China&rsquo;s robust luxury goods market&ndash;estimated at nearly $102bn and growing, and now the largest in the world (surpassing Japan). Chinese people also spent nearly $100 bn overseas, with 65% of that on shopping. Finally, Chinese consumers prefer to shop online, because online retail provides more assurances on product quality and origination than shopping in stores. Needless to say, China represents a significant and unique opportunity for a company like Gilt, which is especially positioned as an online purveyor of luxury goods otherwise difficult to obtain at our price points.Chinese Customers Want Access to Western Goods: Overseas consumption of luxury goods accounted for nearly 60% of total Chinese luxury spending in 2012. Even though the growth of China&rsquo;s total luxury market has slowed a bit, the pace of overseas consumption appears to be holding steady. Because of high customs and tariffs on import goods, local inventory and accessibility obstacles, and other market barriers, it’s difficult for Chinese customers to access luxury Western goods at Gilt&rsquo;s prices. This might partly explain why Chinese tourists are the world’s biggest spenders&ndash;abroad, they can purchase items inaccessible in China.Singles&rsquo; Day, 11.11: One of the primary goals of our China relaunch was to create an optimized experience by November 11&ndash;known in China as Singles&rsquo; Day. Singles&rsquo; Day is the anti-Valentine’s Day: a celebration of singles in which people are encouraged to splurge on themselves. In 2013, Singles&rsquo; Day drove nearly $6bn in sales in China alone, on just one day. That’s 2.5x the sales on Cyber Monday in the U.S. With numbers like that, Gilt saw Singles&rsquo; Day 2014 as the perfect opportunity to drive excitement for our Chinese customers.2. Gilt in China TodayGilt has been serving customers in China since 2011, when we opened our site to 100+ international countries. At that time, our strategy was to partner with third-party providers who could assist us with our international strategy in an aggregate level. Over time, and as Gilt has grown substantially, it has become clear that, in order to provide the best customer experience to all of our users, we must be intentional in tailoring our user experience to the specific needs of our many markets. This requires a multi-pronged approach. Excluding Japan, International represented approximately 10% of Gilt&rsquo;s revenue in calendar 2013 versus 7% in 2012&ndash;and our global growth continues to accelerate. Combining our Japan business, total international revenue accounted for approximately 20% in calendar 2013. Asia continues to be a high-priority, high-growth region for Gilt, and you can bet that China is on top of that list.3. Optimizing for the Chinese Customer ExperienceIn order for us to succeed in China, we had to understand the needs of our Chinese customers and how to build a platform and experience that resonated with their preferences. We sought to understand, evolve and build for:Chinese shopping expectationslanguage localizationlocal payment optionsa mobile-focused approachheavy social channel investmentimproved shipping, logistics and returnspage load and latencyFAQs and localized customer serviceChinese Shopping Expectations Are Different. Customer service, engagement and user expectations in China differ from what western market consumers typically see and have come to expect. With different expectations come different user experience requirements. All of this translates into building products and features that make our shopping experience comfortable, trustworthy and delightful for Chinese users.A) The Chinese online shopper behaves differently. As discussed in this Business Insider article, Chinese shoppers shop differently from westerners. In China, a good shopping experience might include pop-up windows, infinite scrolls, and substantially more information than what westerners are used to seeing. Gilt made a number of technical and operational changes to improve our experience for Chinese users. We also took into consideration these UX differences:  Chinese (and other Asian) ecommerce sites tend to be denser than western sites, with more information/copyInfinite scroll is used much more frequentlyMenu sidebar navigation is used quite oftenWhen clicking on a product, Chinese shoppers prefer to see new product windows or tabs open, rather than view the product in the same page Substantially more images and product information are expected in order to help users make their purchase decisionsB) Quality and authenticity of goods and products. Because counterfeit and fraudulent goods plague the Chinese market, many Chinese shoppers don&rsquo;t trust unrecognized and unverified sites. Being able to establish guarantees of authenticity and having a reputation for offering quality goods is essential. This is one of the major reasons that Chinese users seek out known, reputable Western sites such as Gilt.Language Localization. Making it possible to browse Gilt&rsquo;s website, mobile apps and emails in Chinese was one of our first product roadmap items for our relaunch. Generally speaking, we know that we can’t just focus on English-speaking/reading international users in order to achieve our target growth internationally. While localization is key, however, we need to maintain some English on the site in order to assure Chinese shoppers that they&rsquo;re shopping on a secure, international website. Balance, rather than total localization, is our goal. Our technology team&rsquo;s localization efforts for China included developing:a custom-built, flexible language localization platform that targets static site contentan easy language localization admin for instantaneous translationsa translation workflow for new content and new feature launchesPayment Options. Before our relaunch, Gilt only offered payment options with major U.S. credit cards and PayPal. Just 15% of Chinese consumers have U.S. credit cards, and PayPal isn&rsquo;t widely used, so only a small percentage of Chinese customers could actually buy products from Gilt. To remedy this issue, we began working with Alipay and UnionPay, who represent roughly 75% of the online payments market in China. For payment options and processing in China, we:integrated the Alipay payment platform integrated the UnionPay payment optionlocalized payment and checkout user flow for Alipay and UnionPayoptimized for these payment options to only be available for our Chinese customersWe’re excited about these partnerships and are happy to see that the Chinese press has taken notice. Alipay also shared the news on Weibo. Stateside, our good friend Martha Stewart leaked the news on Twitter a few weeks ago:Tracy Weber of Gilt Groupe is launching product on Alipay next week in time for 11-11 pic.twitter.com/fHvNdq2M04— Martha Stewart (@MarthaStewart)October 15, 2014Mobile is essential. Google recently claimed that Asia was truly the world’s first “mobile-first” region. At Gilt, our experience confirms this notion: Our mobile penetration rates in Asia are substantially higher than our U.S. rate. In China, mobile is quickly becoming the primary and dominant method for online shopping. Additionally, Chinese shoppers are much more accustomed to purchasing and buying goods online than are Western shoppers. To that end, approaching and building for the Chinese customer without considering mobile would be a huge mistake.Gilt executed a number of key mobile-related projects for our China relaunch, including:the launch of our iOS app in Chinesethe launch of our Android app in Chineselocalization of our Responsive Mobile Web experience in ChineseSocial engagement is mandatory. Given the quality and authenticity issues discussed above, savvy Chinese shoppers have forged a lively information-sharing community on social media networks such as Weibo and WeChat. In turn, companies need to establish a presence on these networks to establish their reputations, reinforce their legitimacy and remain transparent with Chinese users who wish comment and discuss their shopping experiences online. Gilt prepared for our soft launch in China by launching our company Weibo and WeChat accounts two weeks ago. We found that users were sharing our fully translated FAQ site, and also commenting how delighted they were about our localized content.To continue building our social presence in China, Gilt is:growing and managing our Gilt Weibo account, which is verified as authenticgrowing and managing a Gilt WeChat account, also verifieusing all of our Chinese social media accounts as avenues for customer service and user interaction. This Weibo user enjoyed our customer service and, through this public discourse, has enhanced our new and growing reputation:“I sent a message to the @gilt account, just to give it a try. I didn&rsquo;t expect a reply, but I received one. Gilt refunded my shipping cost, and now I&rsquo;m happily waiting for my package to arrive. I feel I will come back to Gilt more&ndash;it sells some nice stuff. “ (Translated from the original Chinese text)Elevated shipping and return experiences. China is the leading market for three-hour shipping, the implications of which could be substantial. In the U.S., our expectations for timely delivery have been shaped by Amazon Prime and two-day shipping, but we’re nowhere close to same-day shipping yet. New logistics companies and startups in China are rapidly changing their customers&rsquo; delivery-related expectations, and Western companies may have to catch up and integrate with capable partners in order to meet similar expectations.Given the complex system for handling customs, duties and taxes, Gilt did some research and learned that our Chinese users overwhelmingly prefer to have DDU (Deliver Duties Unpaid) in their international transactions. We also sought out the best international logistics partners possible, and are excited to enable a number of key capabilities for our Chinese customers. These include:direct to China international shipping at $9.95 on orders above $100international returnslocalized-shipping customer serviceenabling DDU as the primary option for handling customs and taxWe still have much work to do in making sure that our customer experience in this area is as amazing as we want it to be, but are on our way.Page load and latency. Anyone operating websites and applications for international users knows that page-load times and latency can be huge issues if you don’t have a local server or CDN to help speed things up for users. In order to have localized Chinese hosts and server support (including CDNs), your company needs an ICP that&rsquo;s licensed and authorized by the Chinese government. We weren’t able to finalize our ICP licensing process in time for our relaunch, so we&rsquo;ve had to be creative. In order to reduce page latency for Chinese users, our engineering teams:optimized the process for loading fonts and images on our sitesimplified the graphical, interaction design and UXselectively reduced the number of JavaScript calls made to external sourcesAs a result of these efforts, on some areas in our site, we’ve seen nearly a 50% reduction in page load times, averaging between 20% to 40% improvements across our applications. This is only a first step: Our teams will continue working to deliver the fastest, best possible experience possible. Ultimately, our goal is to get our own local ICP up and running so that we can deliver our best intended UX for Chinese customers. FAQs and customer service. Given the complexity of international shipping, transactions and purchases, having a buttoned-up and localized International FAQ is absolutely essential. Additionally, ensuring that our Customer Service team can serve all of our customers&rsquo; needs in any and every language is one of our primary goals. Our international customers overwhelmingly prefer to interact with Customer Service via chat instead of phone or email, so our online chat function has been core to our Customer Service strategy. To reduce friction and allay any fears our Chinese users may have about completing their purchases on Gilt, Gilt executed a number of key projects:designed a China-specific FAQ experiencelocalized the China-specific FAQ in Simplified Chinesehired and trained Chinese-speaking customer service repslaunched and grew our online chat capabilities with LivePerson4. What’s NextWhen we started working on our China relaunch five months ago, we didn’t fully appreciate how much this experience would bring together the multitude of teams across Gilt&ndash;from technology to merchandising and marketing and beyond. One of the main reasons I love working at Gilt is that I get to collaborate with so many amazing people&ndash;especially our engineers. Working on this project has strengthened that love. The massive amount of product management that this project required, and the effort and passion that everyone exhibited, may be unmatched in Gilt recent history and as such, I&rsquo;m deeply in awe of what we&rsquo;ve all achieved together. We recognize that this is only the first step of many in making our experience better for our Chinese customers, and we’re excited to continue to grow and evolve with our customers as we learn more from them. We’re excited to apply these learnings as we continue to expand our business in Korea, Russia and other strategic countries. We’re super-passionate about ensuring that Gilt customers around the world are surprised and delighted with their experience with us, every single day.",

HUZZAH! Team Scalasaurus included Michael Reed (Senior Software Engineer, Back Office), Jim Englert (Lead Software Engineer, Push/Email), Kyle Dorman (Software Engineer, Special Operations), Kevin Li (Software Engineer, Loyalty), and me, software engineering intern Helena Wu (Global). We played against ~12 teams from other companies, including ZocDoc and Kaggle. Trivia categories included tech history, emoji programming, and current events. Each trivia round consisted of 10 questions. We didn’t score a lot of points in the tech history category, but we aced the emoji round and drew upon our individual expertise to score in the other categories. Kevin showed his knowledge in obscure, profane programming languages; Kyle knew about the ex-mayor of Boston’s years in office; Jim demonstrated his extensive Java knowledge by listing all of its reserved keys; Michael knew about Sotheby’s latest auction, and I knew about the cuisine at the Noma restaurant in Copenhagen. After the rounds came the bonus question: Name three of the exercises in the Times’ seven-minute workout. We took our best shot, using Jim and Kyle’s fitness expertise as our guide. “YOLO,” we said as we handed in our answers.After the bonus round, the judges quickly computed the points. When they announced the third- and second-place winners and their scores, we started to feel a bit sad. Then the announcer said (paraphrasing here): “And the champions of TimesOpen trivia is… errmm… the name starts with a S…” All of us stopped and thought: “Wait… what?!” And we heard: “Scalasaurus!!!” We were all very surprised and happy! We felt a sense of accomplishment and pride to have achieved VICTORY for Gilt Tech!In my few months as an engineering intern, I have worked on many exciting projects and have learned so much. My opportunity to participate in TimesOpen Trivia Night is just another example of how Gilt Tech is a friendly, diverse and fun environment for every member of the team.",

He and Gilt Data Analyst Debbie Chung had some hunches about how favorite styles, colors, etc. might differ around the U.S. and Puerto Rico and, like any good data sleuths, started exploring.First, they looked at dress colors to see which ones were most popular in which U.S. regions, and found out that black is, um, still the “new black” in every corner of the country. Then they explored how high-heel heights varied among U.S. states, and noticed that the range was pretty substantial. The results of their findings are here in this infographic, created by Rhianon Cha-os.While doing this research, Igor had to learn more about women’s shoes than he’d otherwise like to admit&ndash;addressing the heel-height aspect of “ballet flats,” “booties,” &ldquo;boots,” etc. and figuring out their differences.

        "excerpt": "I work as a lead software engineer for Gilt&ndash;my team focuses on our email operations, from design to distribution. I also spend a lot of time training for endurance events such as triathlons and long distance cycling. During the requisite hours and hours of preparing for these events, I spend a lot of time thinking about my workouts and my work at Gilt. One result of all this contemplating is that I&rsquo;ve come up with an interesting parallel between how a successful athlete deals with stresses to the body, like excess lactic acid build-up&ndash;and how a successful business deals with the complexities of its business (ie excess systems build-up). Let me explain.First Things First: What Is Lactic Acid? Lactic acid is a chemical that builds up in your muscles during intense exercise. Accumulation of this acid in your muscles leads to muscular fatigue. It’s that feeling you get after an intense run, when your muscles just can’t work anymore.Your body removes lactic acid continuously through your blood stream.  A good way to understand this process is to visualize a cup with a hole in the bottom.  As you exercise, you are pouring water into the cup&ndash;causing more and more lactic acid to build up in your muscles.  Water drips out the bottom continuously, much like your blood removes the lactic acid from your muscles. As more lactic acid builds up, your ability to perform is reduced. It’s a non-linear scale. Increasing volumes of lactic acid reduce your ability to perform by greater and greater amounts.What, Exactly, Constitutes Complexity in a Business?My dictionary describes complexity as “many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways.&ldquo;  My own definition gives the term a pretty broad scope. I see &quot;complexity&rdquo; as being anything that changes the parts involved, or the interactions of those parts. A short list of things that count in my book:Employee turnoverHiring new peopleChanging project focusEmployees changing rolesEtc…As you might expect, I paint with a broad brush on the technical side as well:New servicesNew build systemsNew languagesNew data centersDifferent programming ideologies (i.e. reactive, dependency-injection, etc…)New release proceduresAny changed lines of codesEtc&hellip;So, almost everything adds a bit of complexity. But the good news is that most complexity goes away with time. Bugs are crushed. Employees undergo onboarding and get up to speed. Old systems are decommissioned. Systems become more stable.How Are Lactic Acid and Complexity Connected? An organization’s ability to handle complexity is very similar to the body’s ability to handle lactic acid. We can maximize throughput in an organization by monitoring the rate at which we allow complexity to seep in; this is very similar to what endurance athletes do every day. “Saving” a bit will allow their bodies to go further and faster. I think &ldquo;saving&rdquo; applies to businesses as well. Relating this to my work at Gilt: I pay a lot of attention to the rate at which we introduce complexity. I choose projects for my team that maintain a healthy amount of complexity in order to ensure high throughput.   At Gilt, we introduced quite a bit of complexity by migrating between binary incompatible versions of Scala. Libraries needed to be built to support both versions. Projects needed to be upgraded. In the short- to medium-term, this made life hard. As time went on, however, much of that complexity disappeared as we got better at migrating projects and completed more of the overall migration. These natural reductions in complexity are similar to the blood removing lactic acid from muscles. Much like having too much lactic acid in your blood, introducing too much complexity at one time will slow down progress considerably. A business who wants to succeed (&ldquo;win the race&rdquo;) has to control the amount of complexities it introduces initially, and wait for its “blood stream” to cleanse some of the complexities before introducing new ones.",

        "excerpt": "Gilt Corporate Applications is a diverse and vital team of 27 men and women working together across two continents (North America and Europe) and multiple cities (New York, Dublin, Limerick, and Louisville, KY) to make sure that Gilt-the-company continues running. They are the unsung heroes who field all of our &ldquo;HELP! MY COMPUTER IS ACTING WEIRD&rdquo; queries and deal with our failures to reset our passwords. They are the front line in our battles against chaos and negative-surprise. Recently I polled them to find out more about who they are, and what makes them tick.Who they are: systems engineers, technical specialists, security governance analysts, and documentation specialists. Moms and dads. Men and women:Average team-member tenure with Gilt: Three years. Many Gilt people are &ldquo;old-timers&rdquo; according to standard tech-company attrition rates, but Corporate Applications people are particularly loyal. Some members have been with Gilt since its earliest, earliest days (i.e., when we were using Ruby).This graph shows how &ldquo;the Corporate Applications 27&rdquo; landed at Gilt:(In case you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with narwhals, this should help.)What keeps these dedicated technologists happy, healthy and holiday-celebrating at Gilt? This graph (its format is called &ldquo;exploding pie,&rdquo; BTW) sheds some light:Ask anyone at Gilt what they love about working here, and &ldquo;the people&rdquo; is almost always the first thing that comes to mind&ndash;so this result was expected. A follow-up exploding pie seemed in order:More than half cited the ample opportunities to learn and grow on the job. Some team members specifically mentioned learning new technologies, while others cited team-building and management skills. Our pantry options (cold-brew, popcorn, seltzer, fresh fruit and vegetables, and other treats) and flexible vacation policy came in second and third place, respectively.More about learning: Many people enthusiastically went into detail, sharing bits of wisdom they&rsquo;ve learned along the Gilt way:&ldquo;Numbers count&rdquo;&ldquo;Everything requires a ticket.&rdquo;&ldquo;Change is constant so deal with it, Macs are a good thing, and elk makes a tasty burger.&rdquo;&ldquo;Be Agile. Be ready to take on anything and everything with style. Learn from your mistakes and get better for the next.&rdquo;&ldquo;What might be important one day (projects, reports) might not be the next, so don&rsquo;t take it too seriously!&rdquo;&ldquo;The true nature of what the Internet is really for [is] shopping on Gilt!&rdquo;&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, leave it well alone!&rdquo;&ldquo;Work hard and give it your all regardless of the person, situation, or problem.&rdquo;&ldquo;Own your mistakes and learn from them.&rdquo;&ldquo;A great team helps you fix things quickly.&rdquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to try new things. If you break something, it&rsquo;s OK as long as you fix it.&rdquo;&ldquo;Having a relatively happy, respectful workplace with flexible scheduling is more motivating for employees to do great work than anything else I&rsquo;ve ever experienced before.&rdquo;&ldquo;Document it before you break it. Ask questions.&rdquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a disk thick until making the comparison on VMware and NetApp.&rdquo;&ldquo;As much as you think you know, someone knows more.&rdquo;IT folk are not nasty and condescending &hellip;They just have really tough jobs!&ldquo;Learn as much as possible, and use it as much as possible.&rdquo;One respondent developed their own motto for the team: &ldquo;Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose.&rdquo; We need to translate this into Latin, stat.For my last question, I wanted to get to know a bit about what makes the team tick outside the Gilt walls. A lot, apparently:Some of people&rsquo;s interests are particularly worth mentioning:&ldquo;Cigars&rdquo;&ldquo;Welding&rdquo;&ldquo;Lawn work&rdquo;&ldquo;Cats. Playing with cats, baking with cats, watching TV with cats, telling jokes to cats &amp; laughing at jokes my cats tell, laser tag with cats&rdquo;&ldquo;Recreational shooting&rdquo;Writing, performing, teaching in prisons &amp; Occupying Wall Street&ldquo;Walking along the beach at sun set hand in hand&rdquo;&ldquo;Sitting on the beach and taking it all in&rdquo;&ldquo;Spending time out in the bog&rdquo;&ldquo;Researching real estate&rdquo;",

        "excerpt": "Ada Lovelace Day is October 14, BTW&ndash;mark your calendar!In my role as Gilt’s tech evangelist (if you’re asking, “what’s a tech evangelist?”&ndash;it’s a common question&ndash;here’s a start), I prefer to find speaking gigs for the other members of the team. Public speaking doesn’t terrify me (anymore), and often it&rsquo;s a lot of fun&ndash;but it’s more rewarding to watch one of my colleagues get attention (and receive follow-up speaking invites) than to be in the spotlight.Recently, however, I’ve taken advantage of two opportunities to appear on tech-related panels: One at the Nixon Peabody law firm’s office in NYC, and another at the Interop conference/expo, which closed in NYC last Friday. The Nixon Peabody event was a recap of sorts of the previous weekend’s Code the Deal hackathon, and focused on legal tech. Although I earned a law degree a few years ago, I’ve never practiced and don’t really know much about transactional law other than that it involves a lot of “whereas”’s. However, I do know many lawyers who aren’t entirely ecstatic about their workplace environments. So I evangelized the progressive ideas about work culture implemented at technology companies like Gilt. As Gilt cofounder/CTO Michael Bryzek has publicly discussed many times, our team culture is built upon a foundation of trust, autonomy, empowerment, and flexibility. These principles challenge the entrenched workplace norms you&rsquo;ll find in many companies, including law firms: micromanaging, defining leadership by job title/hierarchies, showing preferential treatment to &ldquo;star players&rdquo; (instead of focusing on overall innovation and output from the entire team), and knee-jerk risk aversion (in contrast to trusting smart and capable people to take smart risks). Yet they could work perfectly well in any industry, including—maybe even especially—law. Like tech, law is heavily populated by very logical and educated people who know how to creatively problem-solve.Some might suggest that “entrenched workplace norms” include hiring and workplace practices that hinder women from advancing in their careers. This brings me to my next recent public speaking experience, at Interop. As we all know, women are lagging behind in the tech sector, too. Lemelson-MIT Prizewinner Sangeeta N. Bhatia neatly summarizes the current trend in this September 2014 article for MIT Technology Review:“Girls choose engineering less often and drop out of engineering disproportionately (the so-called “leaky pipeline”).“The percentage of women computer science majors peaked 30 years ago.“The higher I climb, the fewer other women there are at the table with me.”So that our companies are successful, we need to ensure that the ratio of women to men in tech becomes more balanced. There’s much work to do to boost the numbers&ndash;and it’s not going to be easy, given that this sort of thing still happens at mainstream tech events, and women applicants for tech jobs are often told that they’re “just not a culture fit.” Women who speak up and think for themselves are treated negatively in their performance reviews, while their male peers are praised for exhibiting the same behaviors. For these and other reasons, women-in-tech panels remain important. They enable women and girls to learn from other women how to circumnavigate&ndash;or at minimum, prepare for&ndash;these potential barriers to success.  As Gilt’s tech evangelist, I was able to inform the girls at Interop that I work for a company headed by a woman CEO. I was able to state that, of five Gilt cofounders, two were women. I discussed with other panelists some of the other perks of being a woman at Gilt: my first manager&ndash;a man&ndash;supported my career development and helped me build my leadership skills; other men at Gilt, in tech and out, have done the same for me and other womenmy current manager is a woman Some of my male colleagues have suggested that we hold more women-in-tech eventsother male colleagues routinely condemn outside-the-company displays of sexism (often with a “facepalm” emoticon, but occasionally with more forceful language) we have a Gilt tech women’s group that’s open to men, and supported by men In my two-plus years at Gilt, I’ve witnessed male colleagues praising women. I’ve heard male tech execs encourage women on their teams to take advantage of career-building opportunities. And I&rsquo;ve watched most of male colleagues demonstrate one or more of the behaviors represented on this “Top 10 Ways To Be a Male Advocate for Technical Women” list. Sure, our tech team has room for improvement: For example, it would be great to achieve or surpass the 50-50 gender ratio. Stats aside, I’m grateful to arrive at the office every morning knowing that I can expect to be respected and treated as an equal.One of the questions our Interop panel moderator asked us concerned the phrase “act like a man”&ndash;advice she’d recently heard a woman executive share. Should women strive to “act like a man” in order to succeed? I’d say no. Neither sex has a monopoly on any of the characteristics commonly associated with business world success&ndash;ambition, brilliance, toughness, etc. Better, I think, to focus on “acting like a human.” All humans have the capacity to practice open-mindedness, self-respect, and respect for others, while still making shrewd business decisions. The frequent displays of such qualities at Gilt tech, I’d say, are what really make our culture healthy for women&ndash;and in turn, healthy for everyone. Does having a woman CEO affect Gilt’s work culture? Someone asked me this question recently, and I don’t think it’s that simple. After all, not every woman CEO would tell the New York Times that she doesn’t need a personal office. Having leaders who display humility sets a tone for the rest of the team, and that obviously does affect our work culture.This brings me back to trust and autonomy, two values I mentioned earlier as fundamental to Gilt tech’s culture. We manifest these two values in a variety of ways, but one of the most important for building an open and accepting culture involves our hiring practices. We hire people at all levels of the organization who can be trusted to act responsibly, reasonably, and respectfully. People who already reflect our values will help our team maintain them as we grow.&ldquo;There are important skills for succeeding in tech beyond the technical — and realizing that doesn’t mean lowering standards,&rdquo; writes journalist Ann Friedman in a recent article about women in tech. &ldquo;Turns out that valuing these skills doesn’t just attract women, it also draws in a different sort of male employee.&rdquo; Friedman quotes Kellan Elliott-McCrea, the CTO of Etsy:  “The men who come into our organization who are excited about the fact that we have diversity as a goal are generally the people who are better at listening, they’re better at group learning, they’re better at collaboration, they’re better at communication, they’re particularly the people you want to be your engineering managers and your technical leads&hellip;[t]hese people are hard to find, and when you can find them, they’re awesome.”A work culture that champions decency and respect in addition to creativity and talent is a great culture to evangelize. And it&rsquo;s something that any company can create for itself without endangering growth, competitiveness, or the bottom line. Without the stress, discouragement and low morale caused by toxic workplace factors like exclusion, discrimination and micro-management, employees are freed up to be creative and productive. Why wouldn&rsquo;t anyone evangelize that?",

        "excerpt": "The Gilt tech team doesn&rsquo;t need an in-house psychic to help us predict which customers will buy products we&rsquo;ve never sold before. Instead, we rely on the data wizardry performed by our Principal Data Scientist, Igor Elbert, who has been helping us to refine our product performance predictions (say that three times fast) by using various machine learning and predictive modeling techniques. Recently SearchCIO.com spoke to Igor about his ongoing work, which enables us to predict where products will sell better&ndash;and preemptively ship those products to reduce transit time. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:How is the problem Gilt is trying to solve different from what Amazon calls &lsquo;anticipatory shipping?&rsquo;Elbert: We kind of envy Amazon, because their problem is much easier. If you predicted for toothpaste in Orange County, California, you have a reliable past history of toothpaste sales. If it&rsquo;s more or less stable, you can bet people next month will need the same amount of toothpaste they bought from you last month. Retailers have been doing this since forever &ndash; looking at sales forecasts and moving items closer to the customer. But Amazon took it one step further. They said, 'Knowing your previous purchase history, we&rsquo;ll send the product to your doorstep.&rsquo; The model relies on, from what I understand, knowing what you bought before. So, if you bought toothpaste last month, and you&rsquo;ve been buying toothpaste every two months for the last two years, they know you&rsquo;ll need toothpaste next month and they can ship it to you. It&rsquo;s a low risk to them because if you don&rsquo;t need it, you can return it, but it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll actually need it.We don&rsquo;t go that far. We&rsquo;re not going to ship a high-end dress to someone [before she&rsquo;s bought it]. But we try to move products in the direction of the intended buyer early on.Read more here. And don&rsquo;t miss Part II of Igor&rsquo;s interview with SearchCIO: &ldquo;Mechanical Turk supplies Gilt with 'artificial artificial intelligence.&rsquo;&rdquo;If you&rsquo;re attending Strata + Hadoop World, you can hear Igor talk about his work in person when he presents a talk on predictive shipping (Friday, October 17 at 11:50 am).",

        "date": "SEP 23 2014",
        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",

        "excerpt": "Hammer.js is a JavaScript library that makes touch events easier to identify, handle and manipulate. Recently, Hammer.js was upgraded from 1.1.3 to 2.0 and the API was drastically changed. If you’re using Hammer.js 1.x at work or for fun, interested in Hammer.js, or intrigued by touch events in general (but haven&rsquo;t actually used them), this article is meant for you!The Gilt team uses Hammer.js in many of our carousels for tablets, but otherwise sticks to native touchstart and touchend events. In creating a personal project that made extensive use of Hammer.js 1.x, I found it to be an extremely helpful library for identifying complex touch events like pinch and swipe. I also found that it lacked a full set of API features, so I wrote some simple helpers and a wrapper to make Hammer easier to use for myself. The look and feel of Hammer 2.0’s API is completely different from that of 1.x, and includes many of the features that I believed Hammer.js lacked. These are the top five things I think everyone should know about Hammer 2.0 and how it&rsquo;s different from Hammer 1.x:1. Multiple Hammer InstancesIn Hammer 1.x, the Hammer creators advised you to create a single Hammer instance on the page. This instance would most likely be bound to the body, so all touch events would be listened for. As events happened on the page, the Hammer instance would act as a publisher and notify subscribers about touch events. The Hammer instance could be subscribed to different touch events.    var armAndHammer = new Hammer(bodyElement, options);        armAndHammer.on(‘hold’, handleHoldEvent(ev));    In Hammer 2.0, you can (and are advised to) create multiple Hammer instances on the page and bind them to the specific DOM elements where they are needed. The new API feels much more like jQuery event-binding and much less like pup-sub.     var armAndHammer = new Hammer.Manager(el, options);        // or        var armAndHammer = new Hammer(el, options);    Initially, I was apprehensive about the new API approach. The pup-sub model was lightweight and easy to conceptualize, but the approach came at a cost. In Hammer.js 1.x, the Hammer instance notified the subscriber about every touch event on the page, and the subscriber was responsible for filtering touch events to ensure that the element that had been touched/tapped/etc. was indeed the element they wanted to act on.    armAndHammer.on(‘hold’, function (ev) {            if (ev.target === holdEl ) {                    handleHoldEvent(ev);        }    });    Using Hammer 2.0, each Hammer instance is bound where the event happens and ensures the correct touch event happens on the correct element.2. The ManagerIn Hammer 2.0, each Hammer instance is called a Manager. A Manager can be instantiated by calling either    var armAndHammer = new Hammer.Manager(el, options);    or    var armAndHammer = new Hammer(el, options);    The single Hammer instance in Hammer 1.x can also be considered a Manager. In 1.x, the single Hammer Manager automatically listened to every Hammer touch event and broadcast every event it received, whether or not the developer wanted it to&ndash;or whether it was even necessary. For example, even if there were no subscribers to the pinch event, Hammer would calculate and publish any and all pinch events. If you were not specifically listening to this event, you would see no true effects on the page as no functions would be called via pub-sub. That being said, calculating touch events is not a simple JavaScript operation and it was unnecessary for the single Hammer Manager to listen for unused touch events.In 2.0, each Hammer instance is called a Manager. In 2.0 Managers bind to specific elements and are only responsible for the events associated with those elements. To phrase it another way: Rather than assume you are interested in all touch events for a specific element the Hammer instance is bound to, Hammer 2.0 enables developers to create empty Managers that listen to zero events and then specify which touch events this Manager should listen for.    // empty Hammer instance    var armAndHammer = new Hammer.Manager(el, options);     Hammer 2.0 also allows users to create a Manager with a default set of events by skipping the Hammer.Manager constrictor and instead using the Hammer constructor:    var armAndHammer = new Hammer(el, options);    Although adding touch events to the Manager is more complex (because the developer is responsible for adding the touch events they are interested in), it gives the developer more specificity for their touch events. Additionally, this setup becomes much more testable because you know what the setup of the Manager will be on page load. 3. RecognizerAs I mentioned above, in Hammer 1.x the Manager knows about, listens for, and publishes all touch events. In 2.0, Managers start out empty, and the developer adds events to the Manager using objects called Recognizers. Recognizers are essentially objects that are responsible for groups of touch events in the same mutual category. For example, the swipe Recognizer listens for swipe, swipeleft, swiperight, swipeup, and swipedown events.For each touch event you are interested in, you create a new instance of a Recognizer and add it to the Manager. Once the Recognizer is added, the Manager can listen for events from that Recognizer.    armAndHammer.add(new Hammer.Pan({event: 'pan'});        // the Recognizer has been added to the Manager     // and we can listen for pan events        armAndHammer.on('pan', handlePanEvent(ev));        In 1.x, the single Hammer instance essentially came with all Recognizers included. The benefits of adding Recognizers yourself are two-fold:First, each Hammer instance is lighter and responsible for a subset of touch events. Second, touch events can easily be customized. In Hammer 1.x, the options for events such as “hold event threshold” (time a user has to hold down before a hold event is fired) was set on the single Hammer instance, meaning every hold event had to be the same. In 2.0 developers can set the event options in the Recognizer, thus making touch events as customized as you wish them to be.    var myPanRecognizer = new Hammer.Pan({ direction: Hammer.DIRECTION_VERTICLE, threshold: 0 });",

        "excerpt": "More than 150 Node.js aficionados on the grounds of a 15th-century castle, on an island resort in County Waterford, Ireland. Throw in two Node.js neophytes from Gilt&rsquo;s engineering team in Dublin (my colleague, Nick Rogers, and myself), and what do you get? You get NodeConfEU: A lively conference for developers, spread over five days, featuring fun, sun, some great talks and interesting workshops. Check out the ultra-modern conference venue!There were too many talks to describe each of them, so we’ve picked out a few that particularly resonated with us:Alex Liu from Netflix gave insights into how his team manages templates and assets across large sites. Netflix is doing some very cool stuff around producing conditional bundles of assets based on the A/B tests a user is in. Netflix can generate a possible 2.5 million asset bundles based on their A/B testing matrix. Hey Netflix: it might be a good idea to open source this (hint, hint!).Fred George, father of the post-agile process termed &ldquo;Programmer Anarchy,&rdquo; spoke about the battle between asynchronous and synchronous microservices and some of the challenges going forward. Conclusion: synchronous isn’t so great. At a Node conference, that position wasn’t too controversial.Jeff Harrell from PayPal gave an engaging talk on transitioning a large engineering department from Java to Node (a move that LinkedIn made in 2013). He wrote about nine node anti-patterns here.StrongLoop co-founder Bert Belder gave a call to arms to the community around resolving the next stage of development for the Node core. He also expressed some opinions about promises which were present in Node in 2009. I think he might want them back!Thorsten Lorenz from NodeSource presented a wonderfully geeky dig into the internals of how V8 stores objects. Key takeaway: be predictable and define types up front.And speaking of geeky, University of Wisconsin grad student Mikola Lysenko demonstrated how special relativity theory might apply to synchronization in online games by using Cauchy surfaces to prevent causality anomalies.PeerCDN founder Feross Aboukhadijeh gave a great talk and demonstration of WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication). His pre-alpha release of webtorrent, his browser-based torrent client, was very impressive. And by pre-alpha, Feross told us he had only got it to work the previous day!Raquel Vélez from npm gave a talk on robotics and Node that involved the creation of some *cough* beautiful art.As for the workshops: Other than for the session on robotics&ndash;which involved getting to work/play with lots of LittleBits, some nodecopters and a few Tessels (how could anyone not love it?)—the highlight was Ben Acker’s boundless enthusiasm and help teaching us how to be hapi.As for what else we learned:Baseball skills seem to be fairly readily transferable to hurling, as we discovered when the “magical mystery tour” on Tuesday night included a trip to a local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club.Make sure that the person who calls you a taxi knows whether they are calling it for 6am or 6pm.If you ever need directions to a GAA club in Waterford, we can help. We’ve been to them all. Thanks so much to Cian, Richard, Agata and all the folks at NearForm for organising such an enjoyable conference!",

        "excerpt": "Would you enjoy using the Internet more if it were slower? Of course not! But a slower Internet could become the reality for many of us, under rule changes proposed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The FCC’s proposed guidelines would effectively divide the Internet into a “fast lane” for companies that can afford to pay for better connectivity, and a “slow lane” for everyone else. “Net Neutrality”&ndash;the idea that Internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all users the same&ndash;be they small businesses run by a single founder, or global corporations with tens of thousands of employees&ndash;would be no more.On Wednesday, September 10, 2014, Gilt will join other companies and citizens in asking U.S. lawmakers to defend Net Neutrality and protect the Internet&ndash;and we need YOU to join us! On Sept. 10, we&rsquo;ll provide some tools to help you to contact the White House and the FCC to let them know that you support an equal, open Internet. Meantime, spread your support via social media, using the hashtag #NetNeutrality.Why Gilt Cares About Net NeutralityGilt has been able to grow from a five-person team into a company with more than 1000 employees working in cities around the world&ndash;from New York to Dublin to Tokyo to Louisville, Kentucky. We owe much of our success to an open, equal Internet. If we’d been restricted to a “slow lane” when we started out in 2007, getting Gilt up and running would have been much more difficult&ndash;if not impossible. We want other entrepreneurs to have their fair shot at starting new companies that will create jobs, introduce new technologies and business models, and make the world a better&ndash;and more interesting&ndash;place. Why September 10 Is an Important DateA groundswell of support on September 10 will suggest to our lawmakers that they should treat Net Neutrality an election issue. The FCC’s public comment period on Net Neutrality ends on September 15. According to NBC News, so far the FCC has received more than 1.1 million comments on this issue&ndash;99 percent in favor of preserving Net Neutrality. “300,000 comments were original compositions,” NBC says&ndash;a ratio far higher than what most issues generate.Keep the Internet EqualImagine a world where tech start-ups, fashion designers, crafters, and other small businesses never launch&ndash;all because they can’t pay the fees necessary to drive in “the Internet fast lane.” The prospects of this happening should worry anyone who believes in innovation, creativity and the American dream. Millions of Americans&ndash;including President Barack Obama, CEOs, nonprofits, religious groups, even celebrities&ndash;oppose a two-lane Internet. They’ve expressed their support of Net Neutrality in public statements, comments to the FCC and Congress, and past awareness campaigns. But the fight isn’t over: We need the FCC to establish a strong, clear rule that protects Net Neutrality once and for all, so this issue doesn’t come up again. Please join us on September 10 in telling our lawmakers to protect the Internet!",

        "excerpt": "If you&rsquo;re a Business Intelligence Engineer, we&rsquo;d like to hear about your favorite tools and methodologies. Email us at lapple at gilt dot com.Hello, George! Tell us a bit about how you arrived at Gilt.I got here in 2012 after working in business intelligence at Everyday Health, MTV/Viacom, and Hewlett-Packard, and before that I went to school at Cornell.How have things changed since the early days?When I first joined the team, we were still trying to figure things out. Our data warehouse was new, our self-service framework wasn’t built out yet, and our goals weren’t as well defined. Since then we’ve streamlined our processes and become a lot more efficient, within the team and out. We were doing a lot of repetitive work and now there’s much more time to work on projects that will make a difference and that we’re passionate about.What drew you to Gilt in the first place?Just walking into the office I felt a buzz and got the sense that there’s a healthy atmosphere here. Gilt has a great reputation, with a lot of smart people working here. Everyone I spoke to during the interview process, I had a good connection with. Technology-wise, we’re pretty cutting-edge and I was excited to work with the team and learn new skills with the latest tools.What does an average day look like for you?Every day is different, but typically I spend half the day doing analyses, then working on projects for different teams. For example, I’m working with our customer transactions team to get credit card data into our data warehouse, and our loyalty team on getting new AB testing data into the warehouse as well. The data team will help the engineers figure out how the data model will work and look. Projects vary in length and scope, but the ones I’m working on now have lasted a couple months.The data team’s recent work has been involving a lot of open source technologies.Yes. We’re doing much of our current work through new event streams, in which services relay messages to Kafka, and the data warehouse reads those messages. Eventually we’ll use Hadoop for the file storage, with Kafka relaying the messages there and the data warehouse reading from Hadoop. In our work with Kafka, the idea behind it—and we’re not there yet—but it is to create easy access to all of the data within the company, so no one will have to ask an engineer to create a process to access a file or send data to the data team; they can just publish events to Kafka.In terms of technology skills, what should a business intelligence engineer possess?Prior experience using a range of business intelligence tools, a solid background in SQL, and an understanding of how a data warehouse works. But the primary qualification for the job is a good mind for analytics&ndash;the ability to draw connections between different data sources, understand data models, see patterns, and consolidate them into insights decipherable by anyone.At Gilt, a lot of our data isn’t exact, so working with it involves a lot of research. At a more granular level, that means working with various engineering teams to understand the data they’re producing and putting the data together from multiple sources (inventory, site-live inventory, email, click-stream, order transactions) to fit it into a model. Then we run the data through the model to understand its various attributes, and highlight the important attributes to support the various business decisions we make.One of the things we pride ourselves on here is our flat structure. Do you get to work with tech leadership much?I do work with the tech execs occasionally, but I work more frequently with the heads of other departments, like Marketing and Merchandise Planning. The data team works with every department in the company outside of tech: marketing, finance, operations, merch planning, etc. The projects we work on relate to everything from supply chain management, to new marketing initiatives, to understanding our customers and demographics, to AB testing and understanding more about the user experience. Across these initiatives, my role is to understand where all the data comes from, put it all together and make it easy to use for everyone else in the company who needs it. Within the data team, I work closely with our chief data scientist to run data models and see if certain assumptions about our data make sense or not.Talk a bit about the tech stack our data team uses.Our stack currently includes Aster Teradata, Hadoop, Kafka, AWS and AWS Kinesis, real-time data events streams, and lots of micro-services written in Scala. On the front-end we work with Cognos, Looker and Spotfire.What do you enjoy most about working with this stack?Our data warehouse is pretty amazing in terms of speed and processing power. The amount of data we can process, run analytics on and get responses back&ndash;and quickly&ndash;is pretty awesome. A lot of other places I’ve been to, especially startups, don’t have the infrastructure to do that. It’s great to be able to iterate on your analytics quickly—you don’t have to wait for the data to come back.The MR functions that Aster provides, and the functions we can create on our own, make our analytics even faster. And having Scala programmers on our team, who can help write MRs so that we can do things Aster can’t do out of the box, is really powerful.Which technology do you personally use the most?Most of my work involves working with SQL, but also Cognos and Looker. We do a lot of data mining and looking at large sets of data to find patterns.We’ve been a bit bullish about Looker since we started using it. What are its advantages?Looker has empowered people across the business to do their own analysis. It’s generated a collective sense of ownership when it comes to our data and analytics. The more powerful self-service is, the more insightful our analytics can be, and the more the data team is freed up from mundane tasks involving pulling data for people. We’re free to discover new things and take on new projects, not just build reports for the rest of the company.What are your favorite things about your job?Interacting with all the different teams&ndash;it helps me to understand the business more. Designing new solutions and participating in the discussions on how to best approach an analysis, choose the data to work with. I also appreciate the diversity of projects. Usually the data team will focus on helping one department at a time for 2-3 months, but even then we’re still working with everyone.What do you like most about the data team’s culture?Everyone is pretty independent, yet we’re pretty close. We’re all there for each other, but we give each other a lot of leeway to build and develop the way we want to.  And what about Gilt’s culture in general?We’re quick in getting things done.  Everyone is really helpful.  We act on new ideas quickly and we’re not afraid to fail.",

Perfect for the beach, for long flights to vacation destinations, or for an afternoon relaxing at the park. (Even if you&rsquo;re a cat, you can still enjoy the dog days of summer.)Good Strategy, Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters, Richard Rumelt (Crown Business, 2011)A very well-written book that defines strategy in the light of creating execution plans that provide realistic paths to achieving goals. The book is great in distinguishing goals from strategy, and illustrates its point with real-life examples from both successful and unsuccessful companies. After reading this book, it is impossible to think of strategy the same way. Be warned! &ndash;Michael Bryzek, Gilt co-founder and CTONeptune&rsquo;s Brood, Charles Stross (Ace Books, 2014)Charles Stross rarely disappoints, but this book is truly bananas in scope. Yet it&rsquo;s still accessible to the casual sci-fi fan. Set a couple thousand years in the future, the book presents humanity as extinct. In the place of humans are metahumans, who are descendants of robots. The story follows Krina Alizond-114, a metahuman, on her journey across space to search for her lost sister Ana. Naturally, all sorts of adventures and intrigue ensue, which I’d rather not spoil here. While the story itself is terrific, Stross’ vision of a future without humans as we know them, and his detailed backdrops, are really what whisk the reader away from reality. &ndash;Matt Isaacs, Senior Software Engineer/Mobile teamThe Glory of Their Times, Lawrence S. Ritter (Harper Perennial, 2010)Summer has always belonged to baseball, and The Glory of Their Times can help you remember why. Inspired by the death of Ty Cobb in 1961, Ritter decided to do the rounds and talk to all the great players of that era who were still alive. In doing so, he has preserved first-person accounts&ndash;from several points of view&ndash;of plays like the infamous “Bonehead” Merkle, which cost the Giants the 1908 pennant. (The play is named after Fred Merkle&ndash;at the time, just 19 years old&ndash;who didn’t manage to step on second base while the crowd was rushing the field.) Or maybe you will prefer stories like the one about Hans Lobert racing a horse around the bases to see who was faster, man or beast? Baseball has come so far that it all seems like fiction. This book is an oral history of what baseball was like during the turn of the century, and delivers a feeling none of us could ever have known otherwise&ndash;and might not have ever believed, either.  &ndash;Justin Riservato, Director of Program ManagementPranksters: Making Mischief in the Modern World, Kembrew McLeod (NYU Press, 2014)If you enjoy collecting trivia about wiseacres and eccentrics, this is the perfect summer read. Memorable characters in this historical survey of world “pranksterature” include George Psalmanazar, an 18th century character who claimed to be from the island of Formosa but was probably from France. Psalmanazar created his own language, wrote false history books about his “native land” that achieved mass popularity in Europe, and ate what McLeod calls “bloody food” in the company of British high society. Another, more recent prankster is comedian Alan Abel, whose Society for Indecency to Naked Animals advocated for animals to wear clothing and became notorious enough to attract the attention of the major network news. Go here to read an excerpt from the book’s first chapter, which highlights the antics of one of the most famous pranksters in American history (it’s not Ashton Kutcher). &ndash;Lauri Apple, Tech Evangelist#Girlboss, Sophia Amoruso (Portfolio Hardcover, 2014)Nasty Gal CEO Sophia Amoruso begins her book by sharing highlights from her troubled teen years, when she hitchhiked her way up the West Coast, avoided college and took jobs that offered zero opportunities for advancement. A hernia sidelines her for a spell, which she spends&ndash;as she puts it&ndash;“dicking” around the Internet. She opens an eBay store, putting her passion for vintage clothing to work&ndash;and her enterprise takes off. Sophia spends her days and nights scouring thrift shops, photographing her finds and selling them at up to a 150% profit. Eventually her business evolves into Nasty Gal, the $100-million-plus business that has become a household-name ecommerce brand. Throughout the book, Amoruso owns up to her mistakes and highlights the lessons she learned along the way. #Girlboss doesn’t offer much insight into the secrets to success, or beat the reader over the head with motivational slogans, but it does hold its own as a remarkable story of dedication and triumph. Perhaps what’s most intriguing about Amoruso is that her success was solely based on her finding something she loved to do and turning it into a career. She doesn’t preach about hunting down a mentor or needing to take this or that course, but offers straight-up common sense about living and learning (things she was forced to do at a young age). Given its title, you might expect #Girlboss to be full of feminist mantras, or to follow the style of Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In (which highlights all the ways to “have it all” while pointing out all the persistent gender discrepancies that make “having it all” seem impossible). But Amoruso tackles these assumptions early in the book by presenting a fresh and modern take to her generation: “I believe the best way to honor the past and future of women’s rights is by getting shit done. Instead of sitting around and talking about how much I care, I’m going to kick ass and prove it.” &ndash; Lauren Ribando, Email EngineerThe Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov (originally published in 1966)Every summer I read this classic of Russian literature, written between 1928 and 1940 but unpublished until 1967 (when people could finally handle it, I guess). I love it because I still can’t believe that anyone wrote something so surreal and surprising under the guise of “Russian Literature.” This book is intended to be satire, but let’s face it: You are going to miss most of the cultural and political references because you didn’t live in the Soviet Union during the 1930s or study Stalinist history. But it’s still a lot of fun to read about what happens when the Devil and his giant talking cat decide to visit Moscow and mess with people, and how the bureaucrats try&ndash;and fail&ndash;to control them with paperwork and red tape. &ndash;Justin RiservatoBetter: A Surgeon&rsquo;s Notes on Performance, Atul Gawande (Picador USA, 2008)Atul Gawande is both a surgeon and a writer for the New Yorker. This book starts with an exploration of the questions, “We are the best surgeons in the world at what we do … or are we? How would we know?” I found this book to be a great example of how to think about really understanding behaviors, and how to prove what is actually happening in the world through measurement. One of the great stories in the book focuses on cystic fibrosis and how that disease can be beaten&ndash;once you measure the right things. &ndash;Michael BryzekThe Bohemians: Mark Twain and the San Francisco Writers Who Reinvented American Literature, Ben Tarnoff (Penguin, 2014)Back in the 1860s, San Francisco was a tiny, start-up-free town populated by post-Gold Rushers, a growing number of immigrants, and&ndash;as this fascinating new book by Ben Tarnoff describes&ndash;a quartet of ambitious writers who struggled to find their own voices. At the head of this group, at least at first, was moody clotheshorse Bret Harte, who achieved success only to transform into a drunken, egomaniacal self-parody (if he were a modern-day celebrity, he’d be caught DWI and asking the arresting officer, “do you know who I am?”). While Harte&rsquo;s career and reputation sink, his friend Mark Twain transcends a panoply of self-destructive early-manhood habits (making enemies by writing falsehoods and uncouth articles, contemplating suicide, recklessly going broke) to achieve fame and respect as a storyteller and public speaker (marriage to a wealthy, stabl woman only helps). Rounding out the four were poets Charles Warren Stoddard and Ina Coolbrith, whose self-doubts and complicated life circumstances kept them from reaching the level of mainstream success that Twain or Harte achieved. - Lauri ApplePhoto by Josh Antonio",

        "excerpt": "PageObjects enable you to take a group or collection of elements on a page that share some commonality and group them together. In general, a PageObject can be any web page, but can also be broken down into more precise PageObjects. If a Page has elements and services&ndash;or some repeated group of elements and services&ndash;that can logically be grouped together, those elements and services can be modeled as PageObjects.A PageObject can be thought of in the context of a full Page or grouped objects on a Page. Here’s what Selenium has to say about them:“The PageObject pattern represents the screens of your web app as a series of objects … PageObjects can be thought of as facing in two directions simultaneously. Facing towards the developer of a test, they represent the services offered by a particular page. Facing away from the developer, they should be the only thing that has a deep knowledge of the structure of the HTML of a page (or part of a page).It&rsquo;s simplest to think of the methods on a PageObject as offering the &ldquo;services&rdquo; that a page offers rather than exposing the details and mechanics of the page. Because we&rsquo;re encouraging the developer of a test to try and think about the services that they&rsquo;re interacting with rather than the implementation, PageObjects should seldom expose the underlying WebDriver instance. To facilitate this, methods on the PageObject should return other PageObjects. This means that we can effectively model the user&rsquo;s journey through our application.”&ndash; SeleniumAt Gilt, we’ve adopted the practice of breaking a Page into smaller parts that can be modeled as PageObjects. We’ve done this to generate fewer lines of code and to make PageObjects easier to understand and analyze.A PageObject should be an object; otherwise, it should be a class with constructor params that provide the context.

        "excerpt": "In making Gilt.com responsive to the mobile device, the Special Ops team identified several responsive patterns that we relied upon to “responsivize” our site layout. Identifying these patterns early on helped us to more confidently make subsequent responsive-related decisions. For our fourth responsive-related blog post, I would like to share how we discovered and implemented one of our favorite design patterns that we identified: the full-screen modal.The Gilt iPhone app was the primary source of responsive design inspiration for our team. One of our iPhone app’s strongest design elements is its full-screen view for filtering, which differs greatly from the filtering layout on Gilt.com where filtering exists as a set of dropdowns on the sale page and a sticky sidebar on the search page.The app’s filtering:Gilt.com’s filtering:The full Gilt site’s filtering style fits well on both PC and tablet-sized screens, but is too large for mobile devices. This is one of the reasons our current mobile site (m.gilt.com) does not give users the filtering feature. With this in mind, our team emulated the Gilt iPhone app’s design by creating a full-screen view for filtering on mobile-sized screens. This pattern uses almost exclusively CSS (we use less.js) and therefore doesn’t add significant size to the pages’ payload.Full-screen modal was simple to implement, so we decided to apply it in other places on the site&ndash;for example, in a product’s size chart. Here’s a JS Bin that demonstrates our implementation.On narrow screens (a mobile device in landscape, for example) and tiny screens (a mobile device in portrait): Set the content’s wrapper element toposition: fixeddisplay: none          by default, and set it to fit the entire screenAdd a call to action that’s visible only on narrow and tiny screens, and that, when clicked/touched, adds the class ‘content-open’ to either the content’s parent or to the content itselfAdd CSS to display the content when the ‘content-open’ class is addedAdd a no-scroll class to the body when the button is clicked that sets the whole page toposition: fixed           this prevents the body from scrolling behind the open modalAdd a button/action in the open content modal which closes the content and returns the user to the full pageSpecial Ops believes that the best mobile user experiences permit users to focus on a page’s core content without being distracted by other features. With the full-screen modal, we abstracted away all the complexity of the filtering into a separate user experience and gave the abstracted feature the full-screen ‘real estate’ it deserves. Everything the user sees&ndash;a product, a list of products, etc.&ndash;is built around this simplified experience. Now that this pattern is well understood, we plan on continuing to use it in our future responsive design efforts.",

        "excerpt": "In our last blog post on responsive design at Gilt, my colleague Greg Mazurek explained why we use in-selector CSS media-queries instead of blocks. The impetus for choosing this pattern was to make our code less brittle to future development. Today I’ll talk about how we’re applying the same principle to our testing practices.We’ve thought a lot about how we can design our code to minimize&ndash;even prevent&ndash;unexpected adverse changes made during future development cycles. The Gilt engineering team uses automated testing for all of our apps, but in transitioning to a responsive design environment many of these tests have become inapplicable because page elements have been shifted, hidden, altered, or added. Furthermore, if a developer makes a change to a CSS property for a tablet experience, she needs to know whether this change might adversely affect the mobile web experience. A modified class name, a JavaScript side-effect, or a CSS specificity change are three possible negative consequences of such a change. To deal with this potential problem, the Special Ops team has been writing Selenium-automated tests for responsive pages&ndash;more specifically, for each browser responsive breakpoint. (If you are unfamiliar with Selenium, it is a web testing framework that allows you to automate your web application within the browser. Its robust API interacts with your website the way a user would, and can handle automating most scenarios.) First, we have a browser resize itself to the breakpoint we want to test&ndash;for example, iPhones in portrait view fall under a maximum width of 479px, while in landscape its a minimum width of 480px, and a maximum width of 767px. With Selenium, via the web driver object, this is very easy to achieve.Here is a small snippet of what that code might look like:def resizeWindow(width: Int, height: Int)(implicit webDriver: WebDriver) = {  webDriver.manage().window().setSize(new org.openqa.selenium.Dimension(width, height))}This reusable piece of code is what you&rsquo;ll want to execute before the start of each test. Execute it before, not after, the initial page load, to ensure your site responds as it natively would at those breakpoints (rather than scaling your site down&ndash;which could cause inconsistencies with the view). Executing the code before the initial page load will also help you to ensure the automation doesn’t start before the browser has fully scaled down.ExampleTo help you ensure that a page responds correctly to the appropriate viewport of the screen or device, here is a very basic test. It uses Selenium with ScalaTest and a dash of jQuery (there are many ways to test, but this is my preferred way):describe(\"When resizing the browser to 479px and navigating to product listing page\") {  it(\"should fit all the elements within the 479px limit\") {    val expectedPageWidth = 479    resizeWindow(width = expectedPageWidth, height = 800)     webDriver.navigate().to(\"http://www.gilt.com/sale/men\")     // Using scrollWidth instead of width(), to get the true width of the html container    val actualPageWidth = webDriver.asInstanceOf[JavascriptExecutor]      .executeScript(\"return $('html')[0].scrollWidth;\").asInstanceOf[Long]     actualPageWidth.toInt should be &lt;= expectedPageWidth  }}(Note: Your page should not be scrollable to the right.)That’s all there is to it. If you have no other test, at least this one will ensure your site is still responsive. But we highly recommend adding more specific tests that target the functionality of the site.",

        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",
        "tags": "clojure vim lisp",
        "excerpt": "Lisp is an interesting language. Its emphasis on functional programming and properties such as homoiconicity make it quite different from other languages. Although it’s not suited for all developers, those who have experienced building large applications in other languages may appreciate the simplicity that Lisp provides.When I ask other developers for their thoughts on Lisp, the most common response I receive is, “Why are there so many brackets?” As it turns out, Lisp’s brackets establish some consistency across the language that allows for some neat code-writing tricks. So neat, in fact, that they can make coding a Zen-like experience. Read these tips and you’ll soon be able to make onlookers wonder how you’re able to make code fly around the screen so quickly and elegantly&ndash;and with just a few keystrokes. Lisp RefresherFor those of you who aren’t quite clear on Lisp syntax, here are a few basic things to know:Everything is a listThe first element in every list is the “function call position”That’s it! Easy, right? Let me show you a few examples written in Clojure (a dialect of Lisp) to make things more concrete. First, a standard “Hello World” example:(println \"Hello World\")In Clojure, you create lists by using rounded parentheses. The first element in this list is println, so we are calling a function called println with a single argument “Hello World”.Next, we create a new function called inc:(defn inc  \"Define a fn that increments a number by 1\"  [x] (+ x 1)) The first element (the one in function-call position) calls a special function called defn that allows us to create a new function. The other arguments are:The name of the function we want to define&ndash;in this case, incA string comment that we can use as a human-readable description of what our function does[x] is a vector of the arguments that our new function will receiveThe body of our functionIn this final example, we create a try-catch statement:(try  (/ 1 0)  (catch ArithmeticException e (println \"Kaboom!\"))  (finally (println \"We’ve recovered!\")))We can start to see from this example how lists can be nested to provide richer programming capabilities. This nesting actually results in a tree structure (which in compilers is referred to as an ‘abstract syntax tree’) that provides the basis for some interesting coding workflows.The Structure of LispTo illustrate what this abstract syntax tree looks like, let’s draw the try-catch example as a tree:I’ve omitted the “finally” block to keep the illustration compact, but it should be clear now how we can visualize Lisp code as a tree. The workflow tips in this article revolve around making edits to this tree: navigating to parent nodes, moving a branch, removing levels, etc.***I’ll provide these tips specifically for Vim, but there are equivalents in Emacs as well if you prefer that.***Without further ado!Tip #1: Give your brackets some color ‘Rainbow Parentheses’ is a plugin for text editors that will change the color of your brackets depending on their depth in a list. This enables you to visually recognize the start and close of a particular list. Once we can visualize this, it becomes much easier to jump between depth levels.In the above gif, the cursor starts inside the println then makes jumps upward to each parent node in the tree (println -&gt; catch -&gt; try). These jumps can be performed with the ParEdit plugin while in normal mode by pressing \"(\". Tip #2: Keep your parens balancedThere’s nothing worse in Lisp than having unbalanced parentheses&ndash;especially if you have blocks of code that include several levels of nesting. Finding which block is missing a closing bracket can become a nightmare. Fortunately, ParEdit can prevent us from having this problem.Say we have a try-catch-finally block and wish to delete the ‘finally’ clause. In Vim, we can easily remove this entire line when in normal mode by pressing ‘dd’. The problem is that if we do this, we will make our parentheses unbalanced by deleting the closing bracket of the try block (in the above gif, the closing red bracket).The ParEdit plugin solves this by forcing our brackets to always remain balanced. With paredit enabled we can perform ‘dd’ to delete the line and delete everything except for any brackets necessary to maintain balance. Tip #3: Learn motions. Master the brackets!Vim provides motions right out of the box, with no additional plugins needed. The handiest motions for dealing with parentheses are &ldquo;select in&rdquo; and &ldquo;select all.&rdquo; These can perform actions on an entire list in just a few keystrokes. For example, say in our try-catch block we want to return positive infinity instead of print a message. Place the cursor inside the println list, issue a &ldquo;select all,&rdquo; and hit &ldquo;c&rdquo; for &ldquo;change.&rdquo; This will replace the entire println list in just three keystrokes.Note that &ldquo;select in&rdquo; will select everything inside the parentheses, while &ldquo;select all&rdquo; will select everything inside the parentheses (including the parentheses themselves). This command will work with round brackets, curly brackets, square brackets and even quotations, making it useful in other non-Lisp languages as well. Here’s a cheat sheet for using these commands:viw - select in wordvi( - select in round bracketvi{ - select in curly bracketvi[ - select in square bracketvi” - select in quoteciw - change in wordci( - change in round bracketci{ - change in curly bracketci[ - change in square bracketci” - change in quote va( - select all round bracketva{ - select all curly bracketva[ - select all square bracketva” - select all quote ca( - change all round bracketca{ - change all curly bracketca[ - change all square bracketca” - change all quoteTip #4: Nest with ease!Say we want to assign the result of our try-catch statement to a variable name. This can be done in four easy steps:Place your cursor on either the opening or closing bracket of the try block (one of the red brackets)Hit &ldquo;v%&rdquo; to select everything up to and including the matching bracketUsing the ParEdit plugin hit &lt;Leader&gt;w( to wrap the select text in another set of parenthesesInside the new parentheses, write the code to make the assignment(Optional) In the gif I have done an optional fifth step to re-indent the code by selecting the block and pressing the equal sign. &ldquo;=&rdquo; is a standard Vim command to re-indent.Tip #5: Barf and Slurp! Barfing and slurping are terms used in the ParEdit plugin. These operations depend on the location of your cursor. Barfing will eject (“barf”) either the first or last element of the list where your cursor is placed. Slurping is the opposite: A slurp will find the first element to either the left or right of the list where your cursor is and slurp that element into the list.In our try-catch example, say we create a new function called my-function. We then want to move the try-catch block inside this function so that we can call it later. Naively, we could select the try-catch block, then cut and paste it into the function body. Alternatively, in two keystrokes we can slurp the entire try-catch block into the function body! We can perform the opposite operation by then barfing the try-catch back out. The concept might take a few minutes to sink in, but once you understand these operations you will be able to push code around like a pro.Vim PluginsHere are links for the vim plugins I used in the above demos:Vim ClojureRainbow ParenthesesParEdit(Lambda bird formation photo by Sigfrid Lundberg)",

        "excerpt": "This is the second of five posts the Special Operations team is sharing on what we learned while making legacy applications responsive to mobile devices. In our first post, we gave a high-level overview of how we organized a successful team retrospective. In this post, I’d like to dig a little deeper into the technology side of our work and discuss how to organize media queries.CSS3 media queries enable you to present content to a specific range of devices without having to change the DOM. If you have a view, you can use media queries to let your users see content that fits well on a mobile device, a tablet, or a desktop screen. Media queries make it easy to make separation of concerns within stylesheets without having to change the underlying DOM structure.A media query generically looks like this:https://gist.github.com/GregM/78a0c272ff60e388aae9At Gilt, we think a lot about how to use media queries so that they scale across many applications and many, many CSS files. Responsive design only increases the amount of complexity in an application. When you use media queries, your CSS files become longer, and changing the DOM becomes much riskier. To limit the degree of complexity we’re adding&ndash;and also increase Gilt&rsquo;s developer happiness KPI&ndash;we’ve adopted two useful patterns for using media queries. First, we establish variables that define our viewport breakpoints, and we reference these variables throughout all of our .less files. Our four breakpoints try to capture device widths that fit a desktop/laptop, a tablet in landscape mode, a tablet in portrait mode as well as a phone in landscape mode, and a phone in portrait mode. They are:https://gist.github.com/GregM/f0f07fe6501808aef99aIf the variables change at any point, all of our .less  files will pick up these changes. It’s important not to include “@media” in your variables, because you’ll sometimes want to reference multiple media in one query. For example:https://gist.github.com/GregM/b59eae5ac3822172392fThe second pattern surfaced as a result of large, gnarly CSS files. When we first started adding media-queries to legacy CSS files, we added large media-query blocks to the end of each file. We did this because wanted to support IE7 (ugh… and of course, IE7 doesn’t support media queries). So, our .less  files looked like thishttps://gist.github.com/GregM/4183a4e2a88140f2cc68This pattern is OK if your file is small, but becomes quite burdensome when the CSS is so long that the media queries are hundreds of lines away from the selectors that they override. You might have a selector at line 2 that is overwritten for a specific media in line 300. This creates significant opportunities for errors. An engineer working on a selector on line 2 might not think about scrolling to line 300 to change the appropriate property in a media query below.While we were progressing with our work, Respond.js appeared. Respond.js is an open-source polyfill that handles CSS3 properties like @media for IE6, IE7, and IE8, and enables you to include your media queries anywhere. We started using it at Gilt to avoid having to place our media queries at the end of our CSS files.Which brings me to our second media query design pattern: we use inline media-queries on CSS selectors rather than placing the CSS selectors in media-query blocks. For example, we can now write the above code sample like this:https://gist.github.com/GregM/90a2bfa299129734748aGiven this short code sample, the developer happiness gain here might not be immediately obvious. If you include the media query in each CSS selector, your engineer knows all the locations where the properties are being overwritten. This limits the chances for changes that unknowingly impact media queries elsewhere. We’ve relied upon inline media queries to keep the separation of concerns in check for us.To summarize: We highly recommend creating variables to handle your media queries and writing your media queries inside the CSS selectors that they modify. With these two patterns, we think your responsive design workflow will be easier to maintain in the future.Tune in next Monday (July 7, after the American holiday) for “Responsive Gilt.com: Selenium Edition”!

        "excerpt": "Gilt’s Special Operations Team recently spent five weeks creating a legacy Play app that’s responsive to the mobile device for both portrait and landscape orientations. After our team finished our work, we got together to recap what we’d done. We also decided to share with you what we learned while converting Gilt’s desktop experience into a beautiful responsive mobile experience that seemed natively designed. In this post&ndash;the first in a series of five&ndash;I’d like to share how we organized a successful retrospective meeting. As a small team, the three of us who belong to Special Ops (which handles end-to-end projects that don’t fit under the umbrella of other product-driven teams) are always very aware of what our teammates are working on, so we didn’t need to sit in a room to talk about that. Instead, we wanted to talk about some of the higher-level topics that surfaced while we were working in the weeds. To prepare, each of us spent half an hour writing on individual sticky notes the reasoning behind our choices. We then brought our personalized notes to the meeting, which had three goals:List all the things that we thought we did awesomely.List all the things that we want to do and don’t want to do in our next project, so we can heighten awesomeness levels even more. Give high-fives.We rated our achievements and shortcomings in eight buckets:internal teamworkexternal teamworkefficiencyknowledgedevelopment workflowtesting workflowgeneral feeling about code qualityevangelism (getting people outside our team involved and including them in our work)We arranged these buckets as points along a Y axis (aka “the category axis”), and used the X axis (aka “the awesomeness axis”) to measure our feelings of how well we did. For each of the eight buckets, each team member placed a sticky note with their initials somewhere on the X axis between a :( (at the far left end of the spectrum) and a :) (at the far right).Then each of us explained why we placed our initials along the awesome-ness axis with concrete examples and explanations. At the end of the hour, our whiteboard was filled with sticky notes that neatly plotted out our satisfaction and dissatisfaction with various aspects of our work.Our team retrospective was very important for us because, even though we work closely together, each of us gained valuable insights into the primary motivators, goals and concerns&ndash;be it better tooling, better development workflow, better testing processes, or better communication. In software engineering, the work never ends. But by holding a retrospective, we were able to look back at what we did in order to try to continuously improve as engineers.Tune in tomorrow for &ldquo;Inline vs Block Media Queries&rdquo;!",

An image-heavy email will increase the chances of your email client flagging it as spam, resulting in damage to your sender reputation.As a general rule, the best way to avoid ending up in the dreaded Spam folder is to make sure that your emails reflect a balanced image to text ratio.Read the rest of the article here!",

Targeted at experienced Scala engineers, the class focuses on safe and true abstraction with three of the typelevel.scala libraries: Scalaz, Shapeless and Spire.Teaching the class will be Stephen Compall, a longtime Scalaz developer whose Scala knowledge comes from having studied with various typed functional programming gurus. While pursuing an understanding of a higher kind, he&rsquo;s also contributed to Shapeless and the Scala standard library, and writes about type-oriented thinking and amusing compiler games for the typelevel.scala blog. As far as he can tell, he&rsquo;s the only one with his name.More on the libraries you’ll learn about:Scalaz: Functors are everywhereScalaz is a general-purpose functional programming library.  Programmers run into trouble when trying to imagine their seemingly specific and &ldquo;business-y&rdquo; code as merely instances of abstract concepts already provided in Scalaz. We will look at some such code and see how we can borrow the power of Scalaz, by way of higher-kinded types, to avoid writing some of the functions (and eliminate the possibility of certain errors in others).Shapeless: Don&rsquo;t talk about configurationShapeless is famous for pushing the limits of Scala&rsquo;s type system by way of its extremely abstract system of describing data structures and the core functions built over them. As with Scalaz, it&rsquo;s a question of seeing where Shapeless is already part of your code. We will practice the art of Scala constraint propagation to combine highly abstract functions from Shapeless into new highly abstract functions, and use Shapeless to solve the problem of delivering different types of configuration to different modules of code via dead-simple dependency injection.Spire: Make numerical code work fastSpire is the library for numeric code, from people who know Scala specialization for fast, unboxed, optimized code. It manages amazing performance tricks without sacrificing a bit of type safety; in fact, it encourages stronger type safety, even in purely numerical code, by the usual typelevel means: breaking big concepts down into their true underlying abstractions.  We&rsquo;ll see why Spire math functions follow some odd conventions, learn to write unboxed abstract code, numerical and not, by imitating the Spire authors, and get our newly abstract math functions to slow down for testing and speed up in production. When: Thursday, July 3, 2014 from 10 AM-6 PMWhere: 2 Park Avenue, New York, NYCost: FREE (includes breakfast and lunch)Who: Gilt technologists, maybe you tooFill out the form below to submit your contact info.

        "excerpt": "Since 2012 the Gilt engineering team has been using sbt to build and deploy microservices and webapps&ndash;from our newest Scala microservices to our most ancient Java applications. Microservices tend to have common functionality across the fleet, from Play Framework and Akka, to our own internal libraries. Dependencies (and their complex transitive dependencies) have always been challenging to understand and manage. Not surprisingly, the open source community has produced some tools to make it easier. One open source tool we’ve relied on for managing dependencies is Johannes Rudolph’s awesome sbt-dependency-graph plugin. Like Maven’s dependency plugin before it, sbt-dependency-graph produces an ASCII-art representation of an application’s dependency graph, making it easier to understand and spot problems. Unlike Maven, though, sbt-dependency-graph can generate different machine-readable graph formats, which enables composing interesting behavior on top of it. Most of the time, developers just want to see the dependency graph, and sbt-dependency-graph’s default visual output comes up short. By leveraging the machine-readable formats, we can generate even more powerful visualizations. To that end, the Gilt team has created sbt-dependency-graph-sugar: an open-source plugin that provides some sbt-dependency-graph “sugar” to simplify understanding and managing dependencies. If you’re working on a Mac with graphviz installed, sbt-dependency-graph-sugar “just works” to convert the dependency graph to an SVG file and automatically open it on Safari:",

I live in Ira Gershwin&rsquo;s former apartment, so we listened to Gershwin Plays Gershwin in the morning and then switched to Latin jazz in the afternoon. Pro tip: No headphones.Food:We thought about leaving the apartment, but there was a possibility that UPS would attempt to deliver the package while we were gone. So, we chose Seamless with the goal of leaving the apartment after the package was delivered.Pro tip: If you’re waiting for a package, don’t leave the apartment.Meetings:We hooked up Google Hangouts to a television in the room for our weekly review meeting. It&rsquo;s too bad Kinect (cough Microsoft cough) doesn&rsquo;t connect to Google Hangouts, but we still had a way to communicate with anyone and everyone as a group.Pro tip: cough Microsoft coughLocation:We&rsquo;re right next to a park, so we celebrated the end of our UPS-inspired-offsite with a picnic with beers.Pro tip: Don’t forget your Frisbee.Gear:Remember your charger, mouse, mouse pad, and&ndash;of course&ndash;the Jose special: a Starbucks grande iced coffee one pump classic with soy.Pro tip: If your host is a coffee snob, do not bring the Starbucks iced coffee.Pro tip addendum: If you are the host and you are a coffee snob, tell Jose to drink his iced coffee outside before entering your apartment.* The delivery was not a controlled substance but some nightstands. That&rsquo;s right: Greg&rsquo;s team went over to his house just so he could intercept his bedroom furniture. That&rsquo;s some amazing team-building right there!&ndash;Lauri/Editor",

        "excerpt": "Android applications invariably seem to have many places where you have to pack data into an Intent or Bundle in order to pass it on to another component. I have found that packing a single Java object in the payload is far more maintainable than using several primitive key/value pairs. If you decide to add or remove an a field to the object later, you won’t have to go back and modify every single Intent &amp; Bundle. In order to do this, the object must implement either Serializable or Parcelable. I generally prefer Parcelable, even though it takes a bit more code to implement.Unfortunately, I recently ran into a huge pitfall with Parcelable objects. To ensure that my Parcelable implementation is correct, I had been using a very basic unit test&ndash;but I didn’t realize that the test wasn’t actually proving everything was working as intended. One night back in February, I was refactoring some code and seeing ClassCastExceptions when pulling a particular Parcelable object out of a Bundle. I couldn’t figure out where the type was getting switched in my code, but it never occurred to me that the actual Parcelable implementation was at fault because I had too much faith in my unit tests. After a couple hours of digging, I figured out that the naive unit tests I had been using for Parcelable don’t actually ensure anything. Hopefully this post can help you avoid the same mistake.First, a quick summary of implementing Parcelable if you have not done it before. In order to make an object Parcelable, you must handle writing to the Parcel, creating an object from the Parcel, and provide a CREATOR factory. This code is pretty straightforward, although there are a few gotchas. Take a look at the implementation below for class ‘Foo&rsquo;. In order to test these types of classes, I always make sure to write (or generate) a proper equals() method.",

An excerpt:Q. What was your biggest surprise or ‘a-ha!’ moment?Prior to Gilt’s launch, Phong [Nguyen, Gilt co-founder and VP of Research &amp; Development] and I were working through the night to make sure we had a solid footprint for backup and recovery of our data. This meant learning about Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) and write-ahead logs (WAL). I was blown away by the simplicity of the Postgres system. Each log file was in the filesystem. The log file names sorted lexicographically. The snapshot files sorted correctly—they just had longer names. As newcomers, we were able to read the file in the terminal to obtain very useful information as well as some good pointers on how things worked.After that first night of digging into how recovery in PostgreSQL worked, both Phong and I felt very confident that the system was incredibly well designed and that we were able to learn enough and to test end-to-end that our data were safe.Read the full interview here.

Immeasurable thanks to the team at Typesafe for making this event possible.Presentation: &ldquo;Scala - The Simple Parts&rdquo;In this talk, Dr. Odersky will present what he views as the core of Scala. This core is built from a moderate number of general and orthogonal concepts that can be combined quite freely. The parts are simple, but the combinations can be as elaborate and complex as one wants to make them. Sometimes, the ideal of simplicity clashes with other requirements such as generality, interoperability, or ease of use. In every large engineering project, there are tradeoffs. This talk will highlight some of the simple principles underlying the language and also discuss some of the tradeoffs that had to be faced.Where: Gilt, 2 Park Ave., 5th Floor When: Monday, May 19 at 6:30 PM To RSVP: Please register via the Gilt Tech Events (NY) meetup page. We expect seats to go very quickly for this event, so hurry!

        "excerpt": "The afternoon of Friday, May 2 found me on a packed-like-a-can-of-sardines, Brooklyn-bound E train headed for Jamaica, Queens to meet my brother, Jared. Based in Austin, Jared is a front-end developer for RetailMeNot, and he had blown his 2014 convention budget on JSConf, but decided that EmpireJS would be a half-decent excuse to take a vacation and come and see me. We spent the weekend enjoying the fine weather—a relief after the brutal winter we had in New York City—and acclimating him to the cultural differences between South Austin and the Upper West Side.Monday morning we took yet another journey into yet another, different culture: That of EmpireJS, one of NYC’s largest JavaScript-centric events of the year. Held over two days at Location05, EmpireJS 2014 boasted a typically impressive speaker roster: jQuery creator John Resig, Ember.js co-creator (and self-described “Star of Bravo’s hit show Shahs of JavaScript” Tom Dale, Johnny-Five creator Rick Waldron, and many more. This year’s topics ranged from no-build build systems (Peter Müller) to WebRTC (Michelle Bu of Stripe) to “BeagleBone Black: the Versatile JS Underdog&ldquo; (Kassandra Perch of RetailMeNot). Monday afternoon’s bill featured a couple of familiar faces: Gilt Lead Software Engineer Eric Shepherd on “Gadgets for Holistic Web Detection”; and our old pal Mark Wunsch, who recently became Rent the Runway’s Director of Engineering after spending several years at Gilt stirring up scandal(bars). Go here to view all of this year’s fantastic EmpireJS presentations.As the Monday morning traffic rush swirled all around me, Jared and I stepped off the M34 crosstown bus into the desolation that is 10th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. Jared made an offhand comment about a scene from the Ninja Turtles as we took in the construction, the long-term parking, and the largest McDonald’s I’ve ever seen. The conference was in a studio space, which was another contrast to the gritty atmosphere just outside. Registration was calm, peaceful. White walls, white tables, white floors, and warm smiles. The negative space seemed primed for the colorful display that would unfold during the rest of our time there.I made my way to the restroom to wash the New York subway off of my hands. The bathroom was reminiscent of a beauty parlor in Memphis, Tennessee, circa 1987: A chandelier, a 10-foot shabby-chic mirror, flowers in gently distressed vases and wicker hampers for trash cans. The stalls had full domestic doors, and were wallpapered in soft colors. An elegant human contrast to the mechanical subject matter of the conference. I continued on, grabbed a bagel and piled it high with cream cheese, lox, and bacon.I waltzed into the main conference room and was greeted by a multitude of brightly-clothed tables. They were large and round, and orbited a glass pulpit. It looked like the site of an eclectic wedding, or a bizarre family gathering. The speakers and event staff were rushing around in final preparation; the attendees meandered around like sleepwalkers.The next hour was spent trying to consume as much caffeine as possible.The morning’s slate of talks reflected the breadth and diversity of the JavaScript world. A few years ago, if you told people that you wrote JavaScript for a living, it went without saying that you were making web pages. Today you could be building web apps, making games, writing servers, or developing robots. And the community is as diverse as the subject matter: During one talk, the speaker asked everyone who had studied computer science in college to raise their hands, and only about half the room did. JavaScript, because of its default monopoly in the browser, has attracted all sorts of humans who are intrigued by the web: Architects, outdoor enthusiasts, film students, bakers, ex-captains of ships, psychologists, historians, people born in the circus, people raised by wolves … all of these and more find common ground in crafting the Internet. My bagel breakfast barely tied me over till the lunch break. An underestimation of conference attendance and enthusiasm led to an extraordinary lunch truck line stretching up W. 34th Street. There may have been a grumble or two, but they were drowned out by the shouts of joy from voyeuristic Twitterers having something to tell the Internet.The post-lunch doldrums made the comedy stylings of the afternoon’s speakers even more hilarious than they already were. Nothing brings down the house like well-placed cat gifs and DOM Deluise jokes. At least not at a JavaScript conference!As the closing time of 5:30 PM approached, so did some stir-crazy madness. As the day’s last speaker concluded and Bocoup Director of Community Adam Sontag made his benediction, the room cleared as if there had suddenly been a fire or a sweepstakes giveaway. The attendees scattered like animals escaping danger; wild and with no direction, pouring out into the hopeless crossing of 10th Avenue and W. 34th St. in search of food and rest. We had a precious few hours until the Statue of Liberty Cruise/after-party launched down the Hudson River.A few hours later at Chelsea Piers, Jared and I charged down the dock to board the Spirit of New Jersey and were stopped by our cruise directors for a group photo. Being one to never deny a photo op, I posed obligingly. Jared and I then continued our march up the gangway in search of a drink.I bellied up to the bar and bellowed, “What have we got?” Beer and wine were complimentary, and liquor was not, said the bartender. I ordered a Knob Creek on the rocks (“go easy on the rocks”). After accepting my drink I broke from the crowd to walk out onto the bow and admire the cleat hitches and mellow sun turning west Manhattan into gold. I stood brooding and alone in the failing sunlight while I pondered the power this city has over us all.They rest of the EmpireJS tribe arrived and were hustled off the bow as the crew threw off dock lines and prepared to get underway. It was a beautiful night with fair winds and a receding tide. We were directed to the roof deck to get a better view of the city. Manhattan stood glorious in the clear night. As the sun set, the lights sprung to life. Those lights and Manhattan’s sinewy silhouette serenaded us and lulled us into revelry. The drinks flowed, cameras refused to stay holstered, conversations turned easy and generous. The wind-shy found comfort in the galley, which looked like a buffet found inside an Atlantic City casino. An attentive DJ nurtured the dancefloor, which beckoned. Down the Hudson we sailed, taking a few turns under the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. We swung over to Lady Liberty for a visit before turning the boat back up-river. The dance floor filled and remained that way till the cruise’s final moments. When our ship safely docked, Jared and I decided to head home. I set foot ashore and admired the courage of those who fought on to the sounds of Nikki Minaj and ignored the warning signs of an ending party. We were left with the final challenge of the day: escaping 12th Avenue at night. Cabs were as scarce as hen’s teeth, but fortune favored the bold and an empty taxi appeared.Day TwoI wondered if I was the only one who had survived. The mood was quiet and reserved, the EmpireJSers bleary-eyed and sullen. As I sat down to take in the day’s talks, I only spotted those who were conspicuously absent from the previous night’s cruise. Our numbers were small and weak but determined. We put on our bravest faces and carried on with much resolve. The morning speakers were as chipper as the day before and seemed immune to the sparse attendance.Hilarity and hijinks were just as abundant as during the previous day. The comedy stylings of Adam Sontag and Stripe Engineer Alex Sexton harked back the great comedy duos of old, except the jokes were puns about JavaScript. After lunch an impromptu quiz show broke out and Sontag &amp; Sexton offloaded six prize toasters, one of which Adam was rumored to have broken during breakfast. After spending a day with dancing robots, prank WebRTC calls, Japanese image art analysis, and dancing pixels made of box shadows, we gathered in a mass of humanity for a group photo. And as quickly and strangely as it had all begun, EmpireJS was over. Chairs were folded, tables were stripped, and half-finished energy drinks were gathered into trash cans. The exodus of the day before repeated and the attendees fell, like so many Plinko chips, into the nearest bars and pubs. I left Jared with a joyous crew from Spotify as I took our bags home to prepare for another after-party.I caught up with Jared and the others a few hours later on 8th Avenue as we made our way to a place called The Lightbox. It was a long cavernous room with high walls illuminated by city scenes and dancing pixels, and with an open bar at both ends. I decided that the Mount Gay rum was the best offering available and received a generous dose on the rocks.For me, the very end of a technical conference is the most crucial moment. Now comes the time to connect with those who share your hopes and dreams. These are your peers. And while we’ve had time to profess our observations of the state-of-the-art, it isn’t until the social scene changes to a room full of friends who can honestly engage in unrestricted camaraderie. The JavaScript scene seems to expand and change at the speed of the exploding universe, but here we find stability. The JavaScript community is much like the language itself. The language isn’t exactly beautiful or particularly efficient. It’s a mash-up of features and mistakes. But it is the most accessible language in the world. It’s accepting, allows for weirdness, and is free to all.",

A taster:RW: From a technical perspective, what makes Gilt unique? Why does Scala matter?EB: One of our key uniqueness factors is our flash-sales model, which produces some very exciting technical challenges. Every day we experience intense traffic spikes at noon US Eastern Time as the day’s batch of new sales go live. Our members rush to view all the different products, and on most days, our traffic increases by 100 times in just a few seconds. So we have to build systems that can support these sudden bursts of activity. Our solution has been to develop a distributed architecture based upon hundreds of microservices built in Scala. RW: Why microservices?EB: Microservices make sense for Gilt in a number of ways. Gilt started out as a monolithic Rails application, but as we grew quickly we soon found out that this model wasn’t well suited for handling our traffic spikes very effectively. A monolithic architecture makes it challenging to identify who owns what code, and introduces complex dependencies. It also tends to lengthen test cycles and can have unexpected performance impacts.With micro-services, we can maintain isolation between unrelated services and that keeps our development process as friction-free as possible and reduces complexity. It also enables us to establish team ownership of end-to-end quality, which not only makes us all more accountable but also contributes to developer happiness&ndash;our engineers know they can have an impact and see the results of their work more readily.Read the full interview here!",

        "excerpt": "Among the Gilt tech team&rsquo;s most honored traditions is the 5@4: a team-wide gathering, held every other Friday at 4 PM EST, featuring five short (usually) presentations by Gilt technologists. Begun in 2011, 5@4 gives us opportunities to share our knowledge about everything from journaling in PostgreSQL to demystifying concurrent programming in Scala 2.10 with Akka. We reserve the last talk of the hour for a non-tech topic (kite-surfing, Canadian comedy, New Zealand and flags have been a few recent ones), and always serve pizza and a selection of craft beers.Because of the five-hour time difference between NYC and Ireland, our team in Dublin hasn&rsquo;t been able to consistently enjoy the fun and merriment of our NYC office&rsquo;s 5@4s. While our colleagues on the West Coast get the &ldquo;5@1&rdquo; experience by joining in via video conferencing, the Dublin team has no working-hours option. So recently they took matters into their own hands (it&rsquo;s the Gilt way) and launched their own 5@4!Here were the talks from last week&rsquo;s 5@4-Dublin:Some lessons learned from recent service outagesWriting a Chrome extensionQuality NGram extraction for SEObcrypt encryption for passwordsnon-tech talk about the Dublin MarathonWe&rsquo;re super-excited to have 5@4s on both shores of the Atlantic!",

Based in Sweden, Dr. Kuhn was passing through NYC on his way from Philadelphia, where the night before he appeared at the Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts meetup and led a live-coding session.The leader of the Akka Team, and a co-instructor (with Martin Odersky and Eric Meijer) of Coursera&rsquo;s &ldquo;Principles of Reactive Programming&rdquo; course, Dr. Kuhn is also a co-author of the Reactive Manifesto. One of the Akka team&rsquo;s most exciting recent projects is Reactive Streams, &ldquo;an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure on the JVM.&rdquo; Here at Gilt we handle live feeds of all kinds, notes Gilt Senior Software Engineer Giancarlo Silvestrin. &ldquo;To have a standard way to handle them asynchronously with automatic back pressure is something I&rsquo;m really interested in,&rdquo; he says.If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about Reactive Streams, don&rsquo;t miss Dr. Kuhn&rsquo;s May 7 webinar (9-10 AM PST). Also check out Akka Streams, Typesafe&rsquo;s new, open-source Akka implementation of the Reactive Streams draft specification.Thanks to Dr. Kuhn for spending Friday afternoon with us!",

Matt&rsquo;s speaking at this weekend&rsquo;s GopherCon in Denver, Colo. and came over to do a trial run of his presentation, &ldquo;Spray Some NSQ On It.&quot;His abstract:NSQ is a real-time distributed messaging platform, built entirely in Go, that promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee.It was built to support Bitly&rsquo;s data engineering systems and has continued to grow in adoption to power infrastructure at Path, Hailo, Life360, Trendrr, Simplereach, and others. It is a vibrant member of the Go open source community.Building easy-to-operate, large scale, high volume distributed systems for production tends to present unique and interesting problems that stretch ones assumptions.This talk is the product of our experience developing NSQ and operating Go services in production.It covers the evolution of bitly&rsquo;s infrastructure to the design and implementation of NSQ, a match made in heaven for Go. This includes the challenge of optimizing a garbage collected language, managing those pesky goroutines, and a healthy dose of distributed systems.You can find NSQ here at Bitly&rsquo;s GitHub page. Thanks to Matt for spending the afternoon with us, and to Gilt Mobile Engineer Ruxy Staicut for organizing!",

He&rsquo;ll discuss Java 8’s new features, using both Java’s proposed syntax and Scala. He&rsquo;ll cover lambda expressions, higher-order functions, parallel collections and virtual extension methods (aka traits).

My dad is an entrepreneur too — he runs an environmental engineering firm. He’s a huge role model for me. He was just authentically passionate about his people. His employees were a big part of our lives. At company picnics, you would be expected, as a kid, to remember the names of the 200 people who worked at his company, as well as their spouses and kids. My mom was a teacher, and she loves the idea of curiosity. She wanted me to love learning.Go here to read the full interview with Michelle!",

Gilt’s tech women had so many questions for Shan that at times it felt like a rapid-fire round! Many of us were curious about how she manages challenges in her current role compared to when she was at Gilt. And some of us asked for her secret to successfully driving new ideas forward in a male-dominated industry like tech. Her response: persuade, persuade, and persuade some more, without giving up&ndash;and make your points data-based. Zola co-founder and CTO Felix Lung (another Gilt alum), who came along with Shan, listened to the discussion.

        "excerpt": "svc-inventory-request helps us handle our modelling photographyHi, everyone! This is the start of a (hopefully) regular series in which we take a closer look at Gilt micro-services: the hundreds of services that together make up our distributed, Scala-built micro-services architecture. For each installment, I’ll pull a random repo from Gerrit and interview a Gilt technologist about the relevant micro-service. Together we’ll learn more about what micro-services are and what they do, and uncover some of the funny and interesting histories behind some of the code we’ve written over the years.First up for review is svc-inventory-request: an inventory-related microservice created by Gilt Software Engineer, Back Office team member and fancy-cheese aficionado Robert Brazier. Let’s get right to it!What is svc-inventory-request, and what does it do?svc-inventory-request handles lists of fashion modeling shots and other miscellaneous pull requests for inventory. In part, it acts as a proxy to a second, distribution-oriented micro-service related to internal inventory transfers. “It seems to do so little, but there’s so much code for it,” Rob told us (with a sigh).When was it born?The primary work began in May 2012 and lasted through that summer. It was the first Scala project that Rob worked on!Any funny or interesting facts, cool power programmer moves or stupid code tricks?svc-inventory-request was one of the first times Rob crossed paths with Scala’s 22-parameter limit on case classes. While writing it, he discovered a Scala language bug! He submitted it to Typesafe and recently learned that it was fixed in 2.10.3.Back in 2012, the Gilt Back Office team was still in Rails mode, and everyone knew about (and loved?) ActiveRecord. Rob asked around to see if a similar tool existed for Scala, but everyone warned him away from the ORM options available to him at the time. Rob wrote his own mini-ORM into svc-inventory-request! Similarly, there was still a lot of contention around how to handle JSON serialization/deserialization. Rob wrote that as well.  ”So much terrible,” Rob recalls. If he were to do it all over again, he’d use Slick: “It looks really nice for the database stuff.” What’s svc-inventory-request up to these days?Rob says it’s mostly in maintenance mode. The Back Office team is working on several new micro-services that will subsume a lot of svc-inventory-request’s workflow. Our PR team and other non-tech departments still use the micro-service fairly regularly, though.Any last words?Rob: “Don’t write your own ORM.”Stats:First committer: Rob BrazierTop committers: Rob Brazier, Kevin Hyland, Anthony ManfrediNumber of commits (as of March 2014): 196That’s it for now!

        "excerpt": "Gilt Principal Systems Engineer Jonathan Leibiusky is a fan of ETCD: CoreOS&rsquo;s extremely powerful, highly-available key value store for shared configuration and service discovery, inspired by Apache ZooKeeper* and written in Go. Jon thought it would be great if ETCD could also be used as a filesystem. Companies that have already deployed apps that read a configuration file from a local filesystem might want to load these config files to something like ETCD and ensure a consistent view across a cluster of nodes. Given that the Filesystem API is super-stable, widely known and supported, and simple, using ETCD in this manner would make a lot of sense.With this in mind, Jon has created ETCD-FS, which allows you to mount ETCD as a FUSE filesystem. In other words, every existing application can basically start using ETCD as regular files and directories without lots of effort. Implemented in Go, ETCD-FS uses Han-Wen Nienhuys&rsquo;s go-fuse module and CoreOS&rsquo;s go-etcd module and works like this:Every file maps to a key in ETCDEvery directory maps to a directory in ETCDThe content of every file maps to the value of the key in ETCDHow to Install ETCD-FS:Clone the project and build it:make buildThis generates an executable file etcdfs. You can mount ETCD as a filesystem by running etcdfs MOUNT_PATH ETCD_ENDPOINT. For example:./etcds /tmp/foobar http://localhost:4001Then you can access /tmp/foobar and use etcd as a filesystem.To unmount it:fusermount -u /tmp/foobarWhat ETCD-FS Supports:Basic filesystem operations, such as:Reading/Writing filesCreating/Deleting filesCreating/Deleting directoriesWhat&rsquo;s Next for ETCD-FSJon would like to enable users to mount a filesystem to a specific ETCD node (not necessarily or always the root). Less than a week old, ETCD-FS is a work in progress&ndash;but Jon creates quickly, so expect this project to become more and more exciting in short order!* ETCD differs from ZooKeeper in that it&rsquo;s based on the Raft Consensus Algorithm; ZooKeeper has its own consensus algorithm, called Zab.)",

        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",
        "tags": "Gilt Gilt Groupe Gilt Tech",
        "excerpt": "How did you get to Gilt?In late 2011, I was working as a contractor at another eCommerce company, and Gilt was at the end-stage of opening its Dublin office. A Gilt recruiter contacted me, and a few months later&ndash;in May 2012&ndash;I started here. What were you hired on to do?At first I was hired on to be a performance engineer, then I almost immediately switched to infrastructure engineering. Did you have a background in infrastructure engineering?Not specifically. For much of my career I’ve worked at startups as a full-stack engineer. I’ve also founded a couple of startups, and worked in senior roles. In a startup, you end up learning a lot about how to write software and sell it, but you often don’t learn how to scale it in an organization. This is the first time in my career other than my last job where I’ve seen companies out of their startup phase. When you got to Gilt, what did you do first?Soon after I started we came up with a project, Galactica, and I began working on implementing parts of the idea. Gilt being Gilt, I kind of found work that I wanted to do, that wasn’t what I was originally hired to do. The scale of Gilt is nice: it’s small enough that you can get your head around its infrastructure, but large enough to be impressive.Tell us more about what Galactica is and does.Galactica is a family of services that allocates containers via Docker, allows for provisioning of other services, and implements a meta-data model. It echoes the immutability of Scala, the language we use at Gilt. Immutability is important to us&ndash;it enables engineers to do things concurrently and safely, and enables you to avoid situations in which two things try to change your data at the same time. When complete, Galactica will give us the confidence to deploy quickly and often, and if we do break something, we can recover quickly by switching back to the previous version. The previous will still be running, it just won’t be taking any traffic. For now we’re working on or staging, integration and pre-production environments, but will eventually tackle our full production environment in the same way.What do you think of Docker?Docker is lighter weight than any other comparable technology out there, it’s open source, and it’s much easier to experiment with. It’s not a system for providing computing resources as a service, per se&ndash;it really just does one thing, which is to start processes inside containers. Docker lets us to build our own services around it. How long have you been working in Scala?I started using it not long before I started working at Gilt. During the hiring process, I was asked to write an implementation of an interview question that I’d described during my initial interview&ndash;I wrote it in Scala. It wasn’t great Scala, but it was definitely a good thing to have done (it got me the job!).How has Scala made you a happier engineer?Well, before I made the switch I was working in Java and programming functionally in Guava. This was extremely frustrating: I was typing ten times as many characters as I felt was really necessary. Scala was a huge relief: it’s got a steep learning curve, but once you achieve a point of proficiency it’s great. For a learning tool I recommend Typesafe’s courses on Coursera&ndash;some of us took the courses, and it actually changed elements of our style because we saw (Scala creator Martin) Odersky doing certain things, and it gave us permission to do them as well (the content is also extremely good).Can you name one of the ways Typesafe’s courses altered your style?One little thing was using if and else more often. There’s a tendency in Scala to overuse some of its monadic features. Quite often, if you take a slight step backwards and take advantage of its functional programming features, you can produce code that is safe and functional, but also looks better.You’ve actually taught some Scala&ndash;talk about that.Last fall I helped teach a Scala session to some engineers in the Dublin community. I’ve also helped others on the team. I’ve always liked mentoring because it’s rewarding&ndash;it helps you to learn. When you’re teaching someone you find gaps in your own knowledge. Students ask the best questions! We’ve talked about creating an advanced-level Scala course&ndash;I’m going to help with the curriculum.Did you study programming in school?Yes, I have a CS degree. I started programming when I was eight!Are you experimenting with any other languages at the moment?One of the earliest things I did at Gilt was to write a Lisp interpreter. Lisp is something I come back to, because it’s extremely easy to write a Lisp interpreter; also, a fundamental understanding of it enables you to explore other languages quite well. Aside from that, I have checked out Go but haven’t gone deep into it. Clojure is definitely on the list of things I’d like to experiment with.How active are you in the open source community?I’m a contributor to Gatling, a tool for load testing. It generates requests to send to a web service or application at a very high volume. It also measures how long those requests take, and how your application performs under different levels of load. Last year I gave a talk at the Scala.io conference in Paris with one of Gatling’s founders&ndash;we discussed load testing and using Gatling at Gilt.How are we using Gatling, exactly?At Gilt, we’ve found that writing tests in code is much more effective in encouraging people to write tests, period. We don’t have a team of performance engineers writing tests, but a team that writes tooling. We want developers to write tests, and have it become second nature. It’s harder when testing means using a GUI&ndash;you have to learn something new to write the test. The way Gatling works was very appealing to us, and the reports looked fantastic. We took it on, built some tooling so we can run tests against EC2, and now test the site three times a day. We receive alarms if there’s a failure, so we’re now working on a tool called the Smoking Gun Detector&ndash;it will run after every load test, analyze behavior as the log tests saw it, analyze the behavior of the requests the log test made, and identify or suggest backend services that are indirectly accessed as a result of the load test. The intention is that it will automatically identify anomalies. If a load test fails or performs slowly, the Smoking Gun Detector will hopefully point out where the source of the problem is. Eventually we’d hope to have it running all the time, comparing the performance of our services and identifying irregularities. How would you describe Gilt’s attitude toward open source?Gilt is a great company for open source. Many companies restrict their engineers’ ability to contribute to projects or launch their own&ndash;even on their own time. Here, as long as you’re responsible for what you do, and you don’t do anything stupid, it’s acceptable. It’s the same with other things about our culture&ndash;for example, contributing to the tech blog. It’s kind of rare that you have companies of our size that encourage everyone in tech to blog on the company’s site&ndash;usually, there are four or five people who blog, and they present a micromanaged view of how the company works. Final question: What are your goals?I have three types of goals. One is project-based: I’d like to complete Galactica. Another relates to evangelism, both internal and external: teaching Scala, writing blog posts, etc. The final goal is DevOps-oriented&ndash;to continue to drive reliability. Because of the time difference, the Dublin team is up and awake long before the people in NYC arrive at work. Usually if something problematic happens overnight, the Dublin team is working on it. I would like to help us achieve a pure devops culture, where everyone is in ops and has full privileges. I’m trying to encourage that mindset across the organization&ndash;i.e., if you have an interest in how systems work, make sure you get privileges and join in on keeping them working. The way we build now, it’s hard to severely damage something&ndash;but if you do, just ask for forgiveness. ",

        "excerpt": "We&rsquo;re excited to introduce the latest open source project by Gilt Principal Systems Engineer (and Docker talker) Jonathan Leibiusky: Shmock, an HTTP mocking library based on Express. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Express, it&rsquo;s an open-source, Sinatra-inspired web development framework for Node.js created by Canadian developer/Luna author TJ Holowaychuk. It&rsquo;s pretty great!Jon created Shmock to avoid the hassles and errors that typically arise whenever developers attempt to change the behavior of mocking functions. &ldquo;Compared to nock and other well-known HTTP mocking libraries for Node.js,&rdquo; Jon says, &ldquo;Shmock offers a distinct advantage in that it is based on a real HTTP server (Express). This means that you can use Shmock to make HTTP requests without changing the behavior of Node&rsquo;s native APIs or common HTTP libraries. No matter how you make your HTTP requests, or which version of Node.js you use, Shmock will work correctly.&rdquo; And like SuperAgent&ndash;an Ajax API, also created by Holowaychuk&ndash;Shmock is lightweight and easy-to-use.To help you get started:Installation$ npm install shmockUsageInitialize with or without portvar shmock = require('shmock');",

        "excerpt": "On Thursday, March 13 Gilt Co-Founder and CTO Michael Bryzek will be a keynote speaker at the first-ever Startup CTO Summit: a gathering of CTOs representing some of the Big Apple&rsquo;s most prominent tech companies. Michael will join Tumblr VP of Engineering Ken Little, MongoDB Co-Founder/CTO Eliot Horowitz, BirchBox CTO Liz Crawford, and many others in presenting on topics related to managing and scaling a tech organization.One of the CTO Summit&rsquo;s co-founders is NYC technologist Peter Bell, whose impressive range of meaningful contributions to NYC&rsquo;s thriving tech culture suggests that he doesn&rsquo;t need to sleep very much. In addition to being a trainer at GitHub, Peter&rsquo;s a startup mentor, a Thiel Foundation mentor, a CTO School co-organizer, a New York CTO Club member, an author for Pearson, and an analyst for GigaOm. Earlier this week we asked him to answer a few questions about the Summit and its origins:What was the inspiration for the summit?PB: Last month, Lucas Nelson, a Principle at Gotham Ventures, approached me and asked whether I’d be interested in co-organizing a startup CTO summit. I’m fairly involved with the CTO community here as a co-founder of CTO School, a member of the New York CTO Club and and an organizer of CTO groups for Venwise, but I’d always wanted a high quality CTO summit where experienced startup tech leaders would share their experiences. So I thought, “why not create the event that I want to attend&quot;?!How did you create your list of invitees?PB: I reached out to the technologists that I wanted to learn from. There is a great combination of CTOs from well-known companies like Gilt, MongoDB and Tumblr, and other technologists who have amazing content to share&ndash;even if their companies are less “top of mind,” like Matt Story over at Axial Markets. I was astounded by the response. Within a week we’d filled the entire summit with top-tier presenters, and we even had to extend the day to fit in a couple of last-minute keynotes I couldn’t say no to.What are the biggest challenges facing CTOs today, and how might the CTOs you regularly talk to answer this question? PB: Personally I think it all comes down to culture. Your culture affects your ability to attract the right talent, cooperate with the rest of the business, and find and implement the right processes and technologies. The Summit will include sessions focused on process and hiring, but the hard work always relates to building and sustaining the right culture. What is the format of the summit, and why? PB: We kick off with three keynotes&ndash;Michael (Gilt), Eliot (MongoDB) and Ken (Tumblr)&ndash;to give them some time to tell stories that we can all learn from as technologists. We then focus on three topics: process, culture and hiring. For each topic we include three 20-minute presentations to give different perspectives, and then offer a group panel to allow more audience interaction and drill-down into the topics. We also have plenty of networking time, a special presentation by NYU professor Evan Korth, and an end-of-day, two-hour open bar to finish up and give people an opportunity to share their experiences in smaller groups. We’re also deliberately not recording the presentations, so if you turn up you’ll find out what top CTOs say when the cameras are off :)Why should CTOs come to this event? PB: This event has been designed for busy, experienced start-up tech professionals. As CTOs we all get too busy working in our teams to work on our teams. Take a day away from the office, and learn from and network with top startup CTOs who are dealing with very similar issues. The presentations are only 20 minutes long, so it’s going to be a fast-paced conference with lots of content, and the audience will consist of senior tech leaders in startups. We’re skipping the fluff and 101 content and focusing on the surprises and lessons learned by other tech leaders.Thanks, Peter!The New York Startup CTO Summit takes place at Inc Lounge and goes from 9 AM to 7 PM.

(You might call it &ldquo;worry-free continuous deployment.&rdquo;) In this short talk, Jon will describe what Docker is, what it does, and why Gilt has joined other companies in exploring this promising new technology despite its not-quite-finished state. He&rsquo;ll also briefly discuss some of the ways that Docker stands to compliment Gilt&rsquo;s distinctive micro-services architecture (450 applications and counting), and some of the discoveries he and his colleagues have made during their work.&ldquo;The Perfect Provisioning Tool&rdquo;: Mike AdlerMike Adler will facetiously define the criteria for the perfect provisioning tool. The talk is oriented towards service-oriented architecture on IaaS vendors like Amazon.

        "excerpt": "Members of the Gilt engineering team give lots of technical presentations at meetups, conferences, our in-house gatherings, and online. How do we make sure that our content is &ldquo;tech&rdquo; enough to interest experienced engineers? And how do we confidently tell the most compelling stories possible? With these concerns in mind, I&rsquo;ve created this list of questions to ask while planning and preparing a tech talk. All of you engineers out there in Greater Internetlandia might find it useful as you work on your own presentations:Which technology/technologies will you discuss in this talk? Which technology or aspect of technology will be the primary focus: a language, a framework, a problem, a methodology, or a combination of technologies working together? (Or &ldquo;other&rdquo;? If &ldquo;other&rdquo; is your answer, please define)How would you title and summarize your topic so that, if you saw it advertised on a random events listing page, you would regard it as a “must-attend” talk? (If it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;must-attend&rdquo; yet, keep working!)Will this topic be of obvious interest to engineers? What type of engineers? Please be as precise as possible in describing type (for example, “experienced generalist engineers who lean front-end,” “front-end mobile UX engineers,” “back-end engineers who work on big data initiatives involving X, Y and Z technologies,” etc.”)Have you done online research to make sure that no one in the area has given a substantially similar talk in the last 3-6 months? (If someone has already given a similar talk, one option is to take an opposing view; another is to highlight subtopics that the past presenter(s) didn’t discuss)From a technical POV, what is the most novel/exciting aspect of the content you’re providing? And from an implementation POV, what makes your approach remarkable? (In related: What about this topic personally excites and inspires you?)Does your presentation offer a solution to a commonly held technical problem? What about your proposed solution is novel/different from what you’ve seen discussed in other, similar talks/blog posts/tech lit? (Put another way: Does your presentation offer a way to work better/more efficiently/more creatively?)The format that would make this talk most compelling would be (choose one): “how-to,” “explainer,” “argument/opinion,” “case study/narrative,&ldquo; &quot;comparison,” &quot;demonstration&rdquo;Will your talk include a live demo? And what will your samples of code demonstrate or reveal? What notable outside sources&ndash;widely discussed technical articles, others&rsquo; presentations that have gone viral, quotes by well-known technologists&ndash;can your cite in order to place your talk in the broader context of what&rsquo;s currently &ldquo;hot&rdquo; in the engineering community?What are the resources you need to start and complete your talk: research help? guidance with structure? help creating visuals?Who else on your team would you like to bring in to provide objective, constructive criticism, brainstorming help, and feedback? (Pick 1-2 members of your team + 1-2 engineers whose work isn’t directly related to your talk’s content)Feel free to share your feedback by emailing lapple at gilt dot com. And if you have tips of your own, send them my way&ndash;you&rsquo;ll receive a byline here + a link to your Twitter feed, website or other choice online property that you own.",

In 2010, Miguel wrote Las Aventuras de Sela, a Spanish-language, illustrated book for kids ages seven to 12. Sela (also available in eBook format) tells the tale of a seal who must relocate after pollution makes her home uninhabitable. On her quest for new digs, she gets lost for a spell but ends up making some new friends. Eventually she finds clean water and a new home.Miguel derived inspiration for the book during a trip to Dublin (serendipitous foreshadowing); while walking the city, he spotted some seals sitting on a dock and got the idea for Sela. Writing the book took several months&ndash;Miguel spent his weekends and spare evenings crafting the story. His friend Silvia Monge provided the illustrations.Miguel says he has considered creating an English-language version of Sela, but needs to find the time. Meanwhile, he&rsquo;s been working on a novel&ndash;it&rsquo;s not about charming aquatic animals, but about human &ldquo;grown-ups.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s looking for an agent, so if you know one ping him here.",

RSVP here if you&rsquo;d like to attend Erik&rsquo;s talk, which starts at 7 PM at Pivotal Labs!With nearly 4,500 members, NYC Machine Learning is one of the most popular technology-related meetup groups in New York City. What has been the key to its success? And how has the group changed over time? Recently I asked meetup co-organizer (and Errplane CEO, InfluxDB core committer, and Service Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails author) Paul Dix to share his thoughts on these and other questions:Gilt: You started NYC Machine Learning in 2009. What sorts of meetups were you hosting then, and how were they different compared to your current events?Paul Dix: In the very beginning I ran NYCML as a reading group. The format was something like this: I&rsquo;d select a paper in machine learning research or we&rsquo;d find one as a group, everyone would read the paper, and we&rsquo;d meet once a month to discuss it. The first two months followed this format. In the third month, someone suggested a talk they wanted to give. Ever since then, that&rsquo;s been the format of the group. Once a month, we get together to hear a talk from someone in academia, research, the start-up community, or business. The talks have covered a wide range of topics, including Artificial Intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning, search, information retrieval, big data infrastructure, and visualization.Of the (76!) meetups you&rsquo;ve hosted, which have been your favorites?There have been so many fantastic talks that it&rsquo;s hard to pick. Taking a quick look back, I&rsquo;ll just pick four that caught my eye (of course, there are plenty more that I&rsquo;d include in this list). In ascending order by date:Princeton Professor Rob Schapire, &ldquo;Playing Repeated Games: Theory, an Algorithm, Applications.&rdquo; I remember covering AdaBoost in class, so I was really excited to have him come speak. And his talk was really entertaining.CMU Professor Cosma Shalizi, &ldquo;So, You Think You Have a Power Law, Do You? Well Isn&rsquo;t That Special?&rdquo; Cosma is a really well known statistician and has a great speaking style. This one was kind of a revelation to me as I had no idea that many things you think are power laws actually aren&rsquo;t.Microsoft Machine Learning Research Scientist John Langford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Terrascale Learning.&rdquo; John had given a talk at NYCML before, but this one was particularly awesome. The approach he used here blew my mind and made me completely rethink how Hadoop and distributed computing work.Peter Norvig. Max, my co-organizer, roped Peter into presenting, and we just put his name on the event. In my favorites because, come on, Peter Norvig!Why did you start the group?I started it for a couple of reasons. First was a purely selfish desire to try to stay current in machine learning and other topics that interest me. The second was that I wanted to help grow a machine learning community here in NYC. In 2007 I did an internship at Google, which holds internal machine learning meetups every two weeks. Google&rsquo;s meetups weren&rsquo;t open to the public, but the people who came and spoke at the meetings were great. [Google Director of Research] Peter Norvig, [Stanford professor] Mehran Sahami, and some other really heavy hitters would show up and participate in discussions or give talks. I wanted to see if I could reproduce the high caliber of those meetings for everyone here in NYC.What do you think are the key elements of your group&rsquo;s growth and success?The most important factor has been consistency. Meeting up every month is huge. Every time I schedule a meetup, we get new members. The second factor: obviously fantastic speakers. Having presenters who come from academia and business has been great as well. With 4,500 members, we can&rsquo;t get everyone in a single room&ndash;so with varied topics, there&rsquo;s sure to be something every couple of months that any individual will probably be interested in. Finally, having a regular space has been really helpful. When everyone knows where to go, it&rsquo;s easier. You hosted us for a while in the beginning, then we spent a few years at AOL, and for the last few years we&rsquo;ve been at Pivotal. Having access to their space every month has been so helpful.As a seasoned meetup organizer, what do you think are the essentials to organizing a great event?All the obvious things. Have a space that&rsquo;s easy for people to get to and find, offer a good setup for presenters, get an interesting speaker, and ask the speaker to provide as much detail as they can about the talk they&rsquo;ll be delivering. I usually tell speakers to keep the talk between 30 minutes and an hour. People&rsquo;s attention drops off after that, and besides, you want to give people time for questions and networking. I think it&rsquo;s also a good idea to keep the Q&amp;A time limited. People are there as much for the talk as they are to meet and talk to other people. Make sure there&rsquo;s time built in for it.Based on your observations, have any of the machine-learning topics that were &ldquo;hot&rdquo; in 2009 fizzled out or faded away? I think recommender systems were much hotter in 2009 than they are today. I attribute that to the Netflix Prize, which was still going then. Once the team won, and Netflix decided not to implement the algorithm, it seemed everyone&rsquo;s excitement calmed down. Recommendation systems are still important, but it seems they&rsquo;re not as hot as they once were.Other than your own group, what are some of your favorites in NYC?The NYC.rb meetup is the one I&rsquo;ve been going to the longest (since 2005). It&rsquo;s a great group of people, and the topics reach well beyond just Ruby. I&rsquo;m probably about 10x further along in programming and my career because of that group alone. Other ones of note: Ember.js, CTO School, the New York Hadoop User Group, and Go Language New York.What are your goals for NYC Machine Learning in 2014? I&rsquo;d like to get someone from IBM&rsquo;s Watson to come give a talk. I&rsquo;d also like someone to give a talk on deep learning. Other than that, I&rsquo;ll be happy as long as we meet up at least once a month and have a great speaker to learn from.Thanks for chatting, Paul!",

        "excerpt": "2013 was a banner year for Gilt&rsquo;s personalization team. In addition to making headlines in September with the launch of personalized sales, the team grew, got around a bit, and worked on a variety of exciting initiatives&ndash;some of which we&rsquo;re not quite ready to unveil. Look for some announcements in 2014!Generally speaking, 2013 proved to be a breakthrough year for personalization and relevant technologies. Here are a few noteworthy personalization- and big data-related tools, apps, presentations and features that we recommend checking out:&ldquo;The Art of Personalization in a Flash Sale Business,&rdquo; a Talk by Erik LumerGilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer gives an expert&rsquo;s-eye overview of personalization and how we do it Gilt: by generating individualized sales algorithmically based on shopping behavior and personal preferences (including past purchases and browsing, as well as the sales, sizes, categories, and brands that a member has engaged with most frequently). Have you ever thought about how many different interpretations one could assign to something as seemingly straightforward and mundane as &ldquo;blue dress&rdquo;? You will, after watching this thought-provoking talk. &ndash;Lauri Apple, Tech Evangelism SpecialistPredictionIOPredictionIO is a customizable, open source machine learning server based on Scala&ndash;the language we use at Gilt. Created by TappingStone co-founder Simon Chan and a few other developers, it&rsquo;s aimed at making it easier to create predictive features and apply other machine learning principles to data science projects. PredictionIO is built on Apache Mahout, the popular machine learning framework for building scalable machine learning libraries, and appears to remove a lot of the complexity involved in interacting with Mahout directly. It also provides several APIs, including engine-specific APIs for querying prediction results. &ndash;Scott Thompson, Software EngineerApache SparkWant to get your feet wet in parallel processing without having to read lengthy documentation or endure tinkering with configuration? Apache Spark lets you do just that. This impatient developer was able to go from download to running the infamous word-count example in under an hour (most of the time was spent downloading). Spark promises to be faster than Hadoop, both in processing speed and development time. There&rsquo;s an interactive shell, so you know it&rsquo;s developer-friendly. Spark is widely used and has a large supporting community, with libraries written to support cool stuff like machine learning and analytics. And its primary API is written in Scala, so +1 there. &ndash;Yoshi Sugawara, Senior Software EngineerNew York Times Series: &ldquo;On the Path to Personalization&rdquo;Mark Grey&rsquo;s articles on the New York Times&rsquo; recommendation engine provide some fascinating insights into the paper of record&rsquo;s recent personalization efforts&ndash;particularly the ways in which the Times is building its data modelling processes to accommodate for new algorithms and other as-yet-undetermined changes. His posts also serve as a succinct and accessible summary of the many challenges of adding a personalized aspect to an already existing product. How do you add value to the end user in the long term without disrupting their current experience&ndash;and, more importantly, how does that happen under the hood? These are also questions we ask ourselves every day (maybe you&rsquo;d like to help us find the answers?). &ndash;Chester Dean, Program ManagerSpotify&rsquo;s DiscoverWhenever I need something to really help me focus on coding, I put on the headphones, set my chat status to &ldquo;Do Not Disturb,&rdquo; and get down to business. Before opening up my editor, I almost always check out Spotify&rsquo;s Discover screen to find new music suggestions. I like Discover because it employs several different methods to provide me with a variety of recommendations. By telling me why it&rsquo;s recommending a band or a song, it empowers me to make the final call. Should I listen to the Forgetters because I haven&rsquo;t played them in a while? (Not today, guys.) Or should I try Deerhoof because I like Panda Bear and Blonde Redhead (why not?)? &ndash;Brian Ballantine, Lead Software EngineerGoogle NowI&rsquo;ve been really intrigued by the recent improvements to Google&rsquo;s Android dashboard, Google Now. My Google Now dashboard can now derive semantic information from my recent search history and surface extremely relevant content from all over the web in a concise summary to be displayed on mobile devices and tablets. For example, it can respond to the fact that I&rsquo;ve recently shopped for headphones and looked up showtimes for the movie Gravity, and show me new content from all over the web that&rsquo;s relevant to the intersection of those topics as well as those topics individually. &ndash;Will Chiong, Lead Software EngineerPresentation: &ldquo;Realtime Analytics With Storm and Hadoop,&rdquo; a Talk by Nathan Marz This year brought increased attention to (and interest in) real-time computation systems, especially those that provide real-time analytics for business cases where is not possible (or desirable) to wait for long batch processing systems. In this presentation, Storm creator Nathan Marz explains how his project promises to do for real-time processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. The recently released Storm 0.9 version makes Storm simpler to install and manage by providing a new pure Java transport mechanism and a new Log Viewer UI. &ndash;Giancarlo Silvestrin, Software EngineerWe are aligning our personalization platform architecture with the principles of the Lambda architecture that Marz champions here. Two principles underlie Marz&rsquo; proposal: 1) pre-compute everything to ensure consistent response times and 2) combine a batch data elaboration path for the bulk of the historical data (e.g., based on Hadoop) with a real-time path that consumes recent update data streams (e.g., based on Storm). &ndash;Erik Lumer, VP PersonalizationPersonalization in the Home2013 will be remembered as the tipping-point year for reducing the barriers for building personalized hardware gadgets. Amazing platforms like Spark, Electric IMP and Pinnocio have done much to reduce the barriers in both prereq skills and costs, and have also greatly simplified the process for building Arduinos that can communicate wirelessly. I&rsquo;m excited to see what 2014 brings&ndash;I predict the introduction of even more interesting ways to help big data enthusiasts process and aggregate all the data that these and other tools will generate. &ndash;Yoni Goldberg, Lead Software EngineerNetflixAs an active&ndash;one might even say *overactive*&ndash;user, I&rsquo;ve noticed that Netflix&rsquo;s personalization features have had a substantial influence on my entertainment habits. Whether I&rsquo;m looking for a movie, or a new TV show to binge-watch, I can always discover new, relevant content based on Netflix&rsquo;s recommendations. The &ldquo;Because you watched&hellip;&rdquo; explanations are also useful in helping me to analyze my preferences and reasonably predict what to expect. In 2013, Netflix released yet another new helpful feature, Profiles, which provides user-specific personalization across shared accounts and also allows users to receive suggestions from friends. &ndash;Nicholas Mitchinson, Waterloo co-op internUntappdWe are big fans of Untappd, a social network for &ldquo;checking into&rdquo; beers. The Untappd team made some great interface changes this year that really highlight their app&rsquo;s beer suggestion capabilities. Now you can receive beer suggestions based on similarity to beers that you&rsquo;ve already rated highly, and on availability in your area. We&rsquo;ve used Untappd to curate our beer offerings at 5@4 get-togethers, and I&rsquo;ve also used it myself to try new brews. &ndash;Will Chiong, Lead Software Engineer",

        "excerpt": "This past June, mobile revenue surpassed 40% of Gilt’s total revenue for the first time since our founding in 2007. In 2014, we expect mobile revenues to grow even more, which has influenced us to adopt a “Mobile First” approach to development. On the user experience side, Mobile First means creating intuitive and innovative ways to use the mobile framework&ndash;for example, iOS push notifications&ndash;to help solve traditional notification problems and ultimately make life easier for customers. For me and other engineers on Gilt’s security team, Mobile First means continuing to ensure our mobile platform is functionally secure by looking deeper into run-time behavior, traffic analysis, local storage, and caching of our mobile apps.  Though mobile development is a booming market, until recently the range of security tools available to perform deep security assessments has remained limited. To date, the assessment process has been very arduous and mostly manual. Security teams have needed to employ a sometimes hodge-podge variety of traditional tools and assessment methodologies&ndash;for example, proxying mobile traffic through an interceptor tool to capture and inspect network traffic contents&ndash;and combine them with detailed manual code reviews. This method works but is time-consuming, because it requires installation and configuration of a plethora of fragmented assessment tools on a iOS device.However, our security team has recently benefited greatly from some new open source tools aimed to simplify things&ndash;namely Introspy, a security profiler for iOS. With Introspy, we’ve been able to save time and augment automation to the current application analysis process. We learned about Introspy via Twitter. Several of our security-conscious acquaintances began tweeting about it, but one tweet in particular from Cryptome caught our attention:Developed by Tom Daniels and Alban Diquet, and fully backed by iSEC Partners, Introspy was born out of necessity. “The amount of mobile (specifically iOS) work I was doing about a year and a half ago was ever increasing,” Tom recently told me via email, “and anytime we were doing blackbox assessments or unusually complex projects I never felt like I had the appropriate tools to do the job.” Performing even minor tasks required substantial time and effort. After building some one-off MobileSubstrate tweaks, Daniels pitched the idea of Introspy to Diquet, who expressed the same frustration with the lack of tools. “Thanks to iSEC, we were able to get the time and resources we needed and just built it,” Tom says.How Introspy worksAs a prerequisite to installation, you need a jailbroken iOS device. In a nutshell, jailbreaking your iOS device removes all limitations implemented by the manufacturer, allowing root-level access of your device and installation of many unauthorized applications, themes, and plugins (you may notice a UI hack or two in our iOS screenshots below). As this goes to press/blog, a device with iOS 6.1.2 or lower is required. Our team used an iPad and iPhone, both running iOS 6.1.2. Introspy is comprised of two separate components: an iOS tracer and an analyzer.  Both components can be downloaded from the iSEC GitHub repo and installed to the jailbroken iOS device directly from the command line.  Once the tracer is installed, the user can select which iOS apps to monitor thought the iOS GUI. The tracer will hook into the security-sensitive iOS API calls of the apps you choose, checking for sensitive calls relating to security (data storage, cryptography, user privacy, etc).  As you begin using the app, the details of each call are all recorded and persisted in a SQLite database on the device. For the Gilt app, we performed every possible action on both iPhone and iPad apps, paying special attention to the output of critical actions such as logging in, adding a credit card, and making a purchase.  The database results are fed into the analyzer portion of the app, which generates an interactive HTML report displaying all recorded API calls and any potential vulnerabilities or security misconfigurations. If necessary, the reports can be saved locally and distributed to relevant stakeholders. If you prefer command-line interaction (we do), you can use the command line tool to view the tracer’s results directly, circumventing the UI.Pro-Tip!: Comparative SecurityWe also performed some comparative security analysis between the Gilt apps and other popular iOS apps like Amazon and GMail to gain perspective approach to mobile security configurations. We confirmed that the Gilt app has a security best-practice configuration quite similar to the other apps we investigated, which gave us some additional affirmation that we’re doing things right!

        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",
        "tags": "Evan Maloney ios7 iOS 7",
        "excerpt": "iOS 7 brought many new features, and much new work for developers.One of the features the Gilt mobile team was most excited about was background fetch. With background fetch, apps that are running in the background—or not even running at all—can wake up periodically to issue server requests and download data. The purpose is to make the most up-to-date content visible the instant the user brings up an app. In an ideal world, background fetch would kill off the “Loading…” screen that server-driven apps typically present when launched.Background fetch is particularly well-suited for us at Gilt, because we feature a new slate of sales every day. Each day brings updated sale data and new photos to send to the user.Before iOS added support for background fetch, a user would launch the Gilt app (or bring it to the foreground after a certain period of time), and we’d start a flurry of communication with the server that would eventually result in the sales list and associated photos being loaded; the user’s cart and other settings would also get synced. On slow network connections, this process could take a while—costing our users precious time while they raced against other customers before the items in the day’s flash sales sold out.An Unexpected ComplicationWe introduced background fetch in our Gilt for iPhone 4.0 release. Immediately the benefits became apparent: users could access sales much more quickly than before, and they also spent less time in loading-screen limbo. We patted ourselves on the back for a job well done.And then we started to receive bug reports. Users who had logged in and left the “Stay Signed In” option turned on began to report trouble. A day or two (or three) after signing in, these users would suddenly be logged out. They’d sign in again, only to be booted out again within the next few days.Weird.Although we had not seen this issue during our QA testing, we eventually started noticing it on our personal devices. But we could never pin down exactly what we were doing to cause it.As any developer will tell you, repeatable steps to reproduce—the actions a user needs to perform to hit a bug—are critical in diagnosing and fixing problems. After all, how can you be sure you’ve fixed a bug if you don’t know how to trigger it in the first place?We didn’t have steps to reproduce, so we scoured our codebase and tried a number of speculative fixes. We created new test binaries and distributed them to our QA team and internal users. And then we waited a few days to see if everyone who signed in still was. Soon enough, we got the verdict: the bug remained alive.So we’d repeat the cycle again.A LaGuardia EurekaIn the middle of all this, I was about to depart on a long-planned vacation. While waiting to board a plane at LaGuardia, I fired up the Delta app to retrieve my boarding pass. Despite having just logged in a few minutes earlier, I noticed that I was being asked to log in again. I had used the Delta app under iOS 6, so I knew the normal behavior was to keep me logged in.I logged in again, and as a test, put the app in the background. A few minutes later, I returned, and again I was logged out. I tried a few other apps, and noticed that Gilt and Delta weren’t the only apps bitten by the user logout bug.Going on vacation gave me a reason to use the Delta app, which in turn provided the Eureka moment that pointed me in a different direction. Gilt’s mobile team had been working under the assumption that the user logout issue was specific to our app. But now the problem appeared to be widespread—a hunch confirmed by The Verge’s Ellis Hamburger—and this gave us a starting point for researching the problem.When iOS 7 became available, the nuances of background fetch weren’t immediately obvious to developers. There was a temptation to approach this new feature with the attitude: Great! I’ll just take the network requests my app makes at launch, and put them in a background fetch wrapper. How easy is that?Not that easy, it turns out. Because background fetch changes the environment in which an app’s networking code executes, the same code won’t necessarily behave the same way when running in the background.The Source of Our TroubleIn the case of the user logout bug, the problem was that the iOS Keychain wasn’t consistently available when we’d try to access it.The Keychain is the recommended place for storing sensitive information like usernames and passwords. When data is put in the Keychain, iOS ensures that it is stored securely. By default, when running on phones with a lock code, secure Keychain items remain encrypted while the lock screen is on; they only become available after the owner enters the correct code—or successfully scans a fingerprint—to unlock the device. This ensures that someone gaining physical access to your phone can’t perform a basic forensic analysis to extract sensitive data from your Keychain.Before background fetch, most apps could assume that their secure Keychain items would be available whenever they were needed, because most apps didn’t expect to be performing routine operations—much less be running—when the lock screen was on. However, with background fetch, it is now possible for an app to wake up while the device is locked, when its Keychain items aren’t available.The Gilt app periodically re-authenticates with the server and syncs the items in the user’s cart. This ensures a seamless cross-device experience for our users. However, it was also the source of our user logout bug, because our authentication requests would sometimes get issued in the background when the device was locked.In such a case, the Gilt app would dutifully ask the Keychain for the user’s credentials. But because the device was locked, the Keychain would return a null value, causing the app to behave as though there were no user credentials at all. As far as the app is concerned, no credentials == no user, so the next time the user began interacting with the app, they’d no longer be logged in.We never caught this problem in our internal QA testing, because we didn’t have lock codes on our test devices.Don’t Decrease Default SecurityAfter discovering that Keychain access was the source of the issue, we sought to find out how other developers approached solving it. One popular suggestion is to store items in the Keychain with the kSecAttrAccessible attribute set to kSecAttrAccessibleAlways. Unfortunately, this requires using a less secure mechanism for storing data than the Keychain would otherwise use by default.If the only way for your app to function correctly during a background fetch depends on loosening security settings, you should seriously consider refactoring your code. The kSecAttrAccessibleAlways setting allows data to remain unencrypted while the device is locked. The stored data will not be secure if someone manages to gain physical access to your device. At Gilt, we need to be extremely careful about how we handle sensitive data. If we’re going to explicitly change a default security setting, we’re going to tighten that setting, not loosen it.Instead of reducing the security of what we store in the Keychain, we changed our request model to ensure that authentication never needs to be done in the background. If the Keychain isn’t available, we simply won’t try to authenticate.This solution addresses only half the problem, though. In an ideal world, we’d still be able to authenticate and sync the cart sometime before—or at least when—the app becomes active, to ensure that the user always sees the current cart items. If the device is locked, we need to be notified when the Keychain becomes available again, so we’ll know when it is safe to build the necessary server requests.Knowing When the Keychain is ReadyThe key is hooking into the UIApplicationDelegate&rsquo;s applicationProtectedDataDidBecomeAvailable: method.iOS calls this method after the device has become unlocked, so it serves as a signal that we can now get the user’s authentication credentials from the Keychain. This method can be called before the app is brought to the foreground, letting us get a head start with the cart sync.Although rethinking our server requests for a background fetch world required a little more work, we avoided undermining iOS’s default security settings.And since we rolled out this change in our recent Gilt for iPhone 4.0.2 release, we’ve received no more user reports about this problem.The moral of the story?When faced with a seemingly intractable problem, take a vacation. You might find inspiration in unexpected ways.",

        "excerpt": "For iOS engineers, iOS 7 offers a lot to get excited about: Background data tasks, UIKit dynamics, new gestures, a freshly Ive&rsquo;d-up design language…the list is long. Born from that excitement, this week the Gilt mobile team released a pretty major update to our flagship iPhone app. Much is new about this latest iteration of our mobile experience, but here are two new things worth highlighting:A new look and feel that incorporates the UX / design patterns of iOS 7. Possibly the best principle that Apple is driving with its new OS is de-emphasizing UI chrome to get out of the way of content. One of Gilt&rsquo;s best assets has always been its extremely high-quality photography, which we generate in-house. Our photos help us sell products better than any text style or gradient ever could. Gilt’s Mobile team worked hard to eliminate and consolidate some UI elements in our new app, cutting out the tab bar and reorganizing functionality into a cleaner layout.Of all of the great new under-the-hood improvements we could take advantage of, background data tasks had the biggest immediate appeal to us. For Gilt members, being first in line to take advantage of our daily flash-sales offers a real advantage. Background fetches can allow us to pre-cache some preliminary sales data that will allow our most competitive shoppers to walk through our virtual door and buy the products they want the exact moment a sale starts. Turning an OS feature into a competitive shopping advantage is an enormous win for us.When it comes to UI, achieving simplicity in design is often difficult to execute. One of my favorite aspects of our app and its progression is that, despite the increasing complexity of our feature set, it continuously evolves over time to be less cluttered and simpler to use. Want proof? Gilt Director of Mobile Product Christopher Gonzalez put together this awesome series highlighting changes to the launch page since the early days of Gilt 1.x. Check it out! And while you&rsquo;re at it, give the app a try! ",

        "excerpt": "In December Gilt will sell two exclusive models of the Infiniti Q50, each designed by heavyweight fashion designers Zac Posen and Thom Browne. For past car sales we’ve used our standard product detail page, which includes multiple views of the product on sale, a short product description, and a list of materials used to make the product. One challenge for us in building attractive car sales pages is that we have to include all of the terms and conditions copy. As the graphic below shows, posting a lengthy block of legalese does nothing to convey the excitement that a high-ticket, beautifully designed car ought to generate!For the upcoming Infiniti sale, my team and I were responsible for developing a new type of product detail page that would showcase these one-of-a-kind cars. Not only that, we aimed to produce the first Gilt feature that reflected the brave new world of Mobile First: An initiative to optimize pages so that they work equally well on a phone, a tablet, or a laptop/desktop. The end result had to fit our standard criteria for designing pages: It should be equally usable, functional, and visually appealing across devices.We also wanted to create a page that we could quickly duplicate and reconfigure for future product sales. Lastly, we wanted to make it possible for our in-house merchandising team to build these pages with full autonomy and limited tech support.Our solution: the Showcase Detail Page (SDP), which meets all of our  goals and displays the car in an exciting way.Mobile First: Provide Multi-device supportGilt currently serves mobile pages through http://m.gilt.com, using a codebase that&rsquo;s different from our web codebase. In the past this separation allowed us to quickly serve minimalistic pages to our mobile users, but technological advancements and our push towards unification are making this less necessary. Because of the codebase separation, many new features seldom make it onto the mobile platform, and our mobile users are redirected to the full website version. We don&rsquo;t want our fastest-growing segment of users to miss out on the new experiences we create, or be forced to pinch and squeeze their way across the page.Enter SDP, which allows us to experiment with keeping the code in a single, centralized repository and serve and style it in various ways according to the user’s device type. Serving features from one location will make it easier to release features across devices. Additionally, the page will be formatted according to the user’s device, which will enhance our mobile customer’s site experience.In trendy tech lingo, the SDP page demonstrates more of an “adaptive” design rather than a “responsive” design because it changes content as well as formatting based on device. My team decided not to use media queries for the device-based formatting. Instead, we opted for server-side detection to serve slightly different templates and to place a master-class name to key off of for CSS. More specifically:The server looks at the browser’s user agent string and uses regex to identify the device as being mobile, tablet or desktop by comparing it against a list of known devices.The server then places a ‘master’ class on the html element: size-mobile, size-tablet, size-desktop.  We use LESS to create an organized and easy to understand stylesheet. For instance, the styles for one of the components, “showcase-title-component,&ldquo; has the following format://default.showcase-title {...}",

Programmers, product managers, UX designers, database administrators, pythons (well, Pythonistas), and other technologists who use complex, costly machines to develop exciting new ways for all of us to communicate better and faster. People who carry fancy, expensive iThings in their pockets, invent cutting-edge technologies, and sometimes even build their own hardware.And yet when I give them a Gilt pen, they seem just as impressed as if I had presented them with an iPhone made of (real) gold. &ldquo;This pen is awesome,&rdquo; is a common response. &ldquo;Wow, slick pen,&rdquo; is another. They hold their new pen and turn it over and over in their hand, examining its matte finish and decidedly straightforward, simple design. It is as though they rediscover the beauty of the pen all over again.When I run into a past pen recipient, they frequently update me on how their pen is doing. &ldquo;Love that pen!&rdquo; they tell me enthusiastically, usually with a big smile. They say that it&rsquo;s become their go-to pen. Many people ask for another one in preparation for that inevitable day when their beloved Gilt pen runs out of ink. Others ask for a pen to give to their friend or spouse. They want to spread the magic&ndash;the magic of the Gilt pen.Do you own a Gilt pen? What have you written with it?

More details:The concept of symmetry is pervasive across many fields: art, architecture, mathematics, even fashion. In the past decade or so, technologists have begun to talk about symmetry in the context of programming languages and the software programs created with them.In this talk, we’ll explore the meaning and significance of symmetry beyond its superficial, primarily visual characteristics, and connect it to the practice of writing software. In particular, we’ll take a look at the Scala programming language, which manifests a profound degree of internal design symmetry.  We’ll also look at how that symmetry facilitates writing programs that are compact, elegant, and minimal. Finally, examine the importance of breaking symmetry, and introduce some new ideas around refactoring and conservation principles.The event begins at 6:30 PM; to RSVP (and you should!), just go here.",

        "excerpt": "If you’ve got more data than money, you’re probably checking out open source data analytics platforms. But how well do these no- or low-cost alternatives perform in comparison to their more expensive, licensed counterparts? Curious about the answer, I recently conducted an experiment to determine the feasibility of using Hadoop instead of Aster, the licensed analytics platform the Gilt data team uses to store and manage our vast data resources. The TL; DR result: Hadoop performs well in comparison for some use cases.Methodology and setupIn planning my experiment, I didn’t set out to make an extensive evaluation of either Aster or Hadoop&ndash;rather, I wanted to quickly explore how to stand up a Hadoop cluster, then compare it to Aster. I could have made a variety of different optimizations on both platforms during testing, but I wanted to limit the scope of my evaluation to complete it within a reasonable amount of time.Our data team had an eight-node Aster cluster available for testing, and Hortonworks’ documentation recommended setting up clusters in multiples of three to support the default replication factor of three, so my test involved eight Aster nodes vs. nine Hadoop nodes. The exact setup: Aster 5.0.2 on eight nodes, with a replication factor of twoHortonworks 2.0 Community Preview distribution on nine nodes, with a default replication factor of threeHive 0.11What I evaluated, and whyFor test data, I used two months of raw, Gilt clickstream data&ndash;approximately 900 million rows (~120GB compressed on disk). To test Aster, I used an unindexed, row storage table. To test Hadoop, I chose two table formats: raw gzip compressed files logically partitioned by month, and an Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) table with compression [ORC Format]. The load times between Aster and Hadoop column store were comparable.A few notes:The load into Aster includes time to decompress gzipped filesThe load into the Hadoop column store table was done using the raw Hadoop table, so the actual load time includes the loading of the raw Hadoop table.To compare the results of performance tests using Aster, Hadoop with raw data, and Hadoop with column store data, I used identical data sets in all tests; ran the tests at times when there was no other activity on the cluster; and made some basic query optimizations as described in the documentation for Hive. Once again, lower was better.Regarding the query performance of progressively larger data-sets on Hadoop and Aster, I performed the test using a single-column table with an increasing number of rows&ndash; first one row, then 10K, 1 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, and 20 billion&ndash;and at times when there was no other activity on the cluster. Comparable performance once again.After running this evaluation, I&rsquo;ve concluded that HDFS can be useful for storing raw data (log files, etc.) or archival of older transformed data. But the day-to-day activities in the data warehouse space (SQL, analysis, etc.) should remain in Aster. HDFS is not a perfect substitution: For example, I’ve also noted that Hive requires some effort and patience to get it working; it’s unstable when using with embedded metastores. And sometimes it throws exceptions for which I wasn’t able to find resolutions: for example, “java.sql.SQLException: Error retrieving next row,” and&ndash;when selecting from ORC tables&ndash;“java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error.” (Using MySQL to store metadata seemed to improve Hive’s stability.)  Other problems: Orphaned/Zombie jobs could be problematic&ndash;you need to manually intervene to kill those jobs. You need to be careful when designing table structures, because that is the biggest factor in performance of queries (storage format, compression, clustering, partitioning, skew, serde). Finally, Hadoop’s concurrency sucks: The first query/job receives the bulk of your resources. (The documentation says that significant improvements were made in the resource manager, known as YARN, but sometimes jobs/queries are blocked until a running job/query completes.)Running your own testThere are still many unexplored options for optimizing for performance. If you can identify some real-world use cases, then you can optimize Hive with logical partitioning, physical partitioning (clustering), sorted data storage, and indexing. Similarly, you can also optimize Aster to use column stores, logical partitioning, physical partitioning, indexing, etc. Interested in our work with big data?

        "excerpt": "What do you do at Gilt?I&rsquo;m a senior software engineer who works on the platform team in Dublin. I focus on integrating the load and performance testing platform into Ion Cannon.What did you do before joining us?Before I came to Gilt this past summer, I was with Amazon for five years. I owned the cart service for 2 years, then moved on to the monitoring group, where I spent time with the user experience group, and then the logs team.Before that, I spent five years with a Galway-based telecom start-up. I also worked for Full Tilt Poker for a while (but I swear I had nothing to do with them going under. Poker players will know what happened there).What are some other interesting things we should know about you?I&rsquo;m originally from Romania, and have lived in Ireland for the past 12-plus years. I&rsquo;m in love with American football, and have been a Denver Broncos fan since 1996. Right now the Broncos are 4-0, have broken a few records, and are favorites to win the Super Bowl, so that all makes me happy. I run virtual machines at home, but they’re all just pet projects.When did you start programming?I started in high school. Computers were not very common in communist Romania, but I encountered them as part of a class trip to a university in Craiova&ndash;my hometown. The university had an IT center, and after that trip I transferred to the appropriate class there and learned coding. I ended up building programs in Fortran for students who needed them for their university classes. I did this for a few hours every day&ndash;so much so, that my parents firmly believed that my high school classes took 10 hours a day!After high school I went to the CS college so I could follow this route. I&rsquo;ve been coding ever since. Even if the coding work was not for class, I would write code for other stuff. I also learned many languages, starting with Fortran and Basic, then Pascal, then C++.How did you get to Gilt?I had heard that Gilt would be a very good fit for my skills set. And Gilt agreed. Basically, my current team’s needs matched my skills very well from my previous work at Amazon, and I was looking for a new challenge, so I said yes to the opportunity.Thinking back to your interview, what stood out for you most?It seemed there were some opportunities to start some new initiatives from scratch&ndash;opportunities that I hadn&rsquo;t had in my previous jobs, where I had to do a lot of legacy work. I was attracted by the performance engineering domain, because it’s one thing that helps and empowers developers to improve and control the quality of their work. What did you think about joining a Scala shop like Gilt?I see languages as tools for the job. I don’t see myself as a Java developer, or a Scala developer, but as a software developer. I think you shouldn’t get stuck with one tool&ndash;you should diversify and learn the trade of development, and not focus all your energy on how to operate a specific tool.I’ve always learned new tools for different projects that I’ve encountered along the way. I can write code in a very large number of languages, not all of them to great quality, but if need be I can ramp up my skills. In my career, I first learned and used C++, so at Amazon I first moved to the C++ team. Then I moved over to Java and learned it on the job. Now I&rsquo;m learning Scala on the job. I did the Coursera course, and am now getting a lot of help from my teammates on code reviews.What do you appreciate most about Scala?Scala offers so many ways to write the same thing. Some ways are more succinct than others, and I’m trying to write the kind of code that other people will like to read and maintain.Working with people who have very good programming skills has been very helpful.What have you been working on since you got here?In my first few months I designed a log aggregation solution and wrote a few of my first services in Scala, getting them code-reviewed in Dublin. I felt happy that my first few contributions got the thumbs-up from the guys&ndash;that means I’m writing quality Scala code now. The other area I’m involved in is load testing, which we’re planning to develop as a platform so we can integrate it with the build-and-deploy, Ion-Cannon process.What do you like most about performance engineering?I like the impact that performance engineering has on other developers. Being in performance engineering means that you have to raise the bar and be at the forefront of quality. What we are about as a group is quality. The best tested code should be the one that does tests for others. How would you describe our performance engineering style?It&rsquo;s set up mostly so that the engineers can release early and often; it gives us the tool set that releases us from worry. It’s very important for a developer to be able to release when they feel like it, because it speeds up the development process while maintaining good quality. It also should lead&ndash;and does lead, most of the time&ndash;to innovation. If you’re not afraid to try new things because you’re confident that you’re not breaking everything, you can innovate faster. The &ldquo;zero waiting&rdquo; concept that we&rsquo;re trying to develop frees up developers from being blocked by other people, or a lack of tools; here, we can do most of the things ourselves.And with Galactica, we’re trying to make our infrastructure as elastic as possible so that we no longer have to wait for things to become available. It&rsquo;s the same concept of zero waiting&ndash;you can get infrastructure on demand.What has your experience working with a transcontinental team been like?In late summer I visited NYC and met a lot of the team there; it’s very important to be able to put faces to names. I also spent some of my time there gauging interest in this log aggregation project we’re trying to create in Dublin. Having team members across the Atlantic is not difficult, as there is a lot of overlap in the work hours between Dublin and NYC.Tech-wise, what do you like to read?I follow several blogs and read magazines like Wired, Linux Format and Mac Format. I read mostly on my iPad&ndash;I commute to work by train now, and read a lot on the train.What are some of your goals at Gilt?The two projects I spoke about&ndash;3-6 months is the goal to get load testing integrated with the built system and get the log aggregation off the ground, to start pulling logs and integrating them. It has to go hand-in-hand with Galactica. I also want to learn more about Scala and sbt. It’s essential to have as much hands-on experience as possible.",

        "excerpt": "Next week Typesafe Developer Advocate James Ward will present (at least) three talks in New York City: &ldquo;Diving Into Play Framework&rsquo;s Deep End&rdquo; (10/8 at Amplify); &ldquo;Building Reactive Apps&rdquo; (hosted by NYJavaSIG on 10/9 at Credit Suisse) and &ldquo;Intro to Play Framework&rdquo; (hosted by NY-Scala on 10/10 at Meetup). James was kind enough to take a few moments to answer some questions for us.Gilt: How did you come to work at Typesafe? What attracted you to your current role?James Ward: I started using Play Framework a few years ago and was very impressed with how powerful and yet simple it is. One year ago the opportunity arose to become a Developer Advocate at Typesafe and I couldn&rsquo;t resist.  Since then I&rsquo;ve been learning more about Akka and Scala and see many similarities with Play. Akka provides a simple abstraction for concurrent systems, and Scala is a very powerful language where my code becomes more concise and readable the more I learn about it.  It is a ton of fun to evangelize technologies that developers love!G: In your &ldquo;A Java Developer&rsquo;s Primer to the Typesafe Platform&rdquo; talk, what are the key things you try to emphasize? What is the response from developers? JW: Lately I&rsquo;ve been talking about building Reactive applications. Recently the Reactive Manifesto was published to coalesce some of the emerging patterns in software development. Java developers are always pleasantly surprised by the power and simplicity of building Reactive applications with the Typesafe Platform: Play Framework, Akka, and Scala/Java.G: How would you explain to a newbie the differences between Play and other frameworks, highlighting Play&rsquo;s advantages?JW: Play Framework does a great job of getting out of the way so that I can easily implement RESTful JSON services or use abstractions to build complex Single Page Apps. One of the best parts of Play is its developer friendliness. The &ldquo;just hit refresh&rdquo; workflow supports a high-velocity development experience while still using type-safe languages. Play also includes native support for modern APIs like WebSockets, and tools like CoffeeScript and LESS asset compilers.G: Could you talk a bit about WebSockets and actor integration, and offer some tips or best practices?JW: Modern web applications often need to react in real-time to events and changing data. This requires a scalable way to push data from the server to the client. WebSockets offer a great way to do that. The WebSocket is just a channel, so when combined with an Akka Actor, applications have a great way to build event-driven applications that extend all the way out to the client.G: Could you provide any tips for handling JSON in Play 2.1? Of all the available options&ndash;transformers, macro inception, combinators, JsResult&ndash;what&rsquo;s the best to pursue?JW: Typical JSON APIs are pretty basic, as they are primarily meant for serializing and deserializing data. Play&rsquo;s Scala JSON API goes way beyond typical data marshaling, enabling developers to do powerful transformation and validation of JSON data. One of the coolest examples of this is called &ldquo;JSON Coast to Coast,&rdquo; where data is stored in a JSON data-store, possibly composed together with JSON from other datasources, transformed, and sent to the client using a Reactive (async + non-blocking) connection. Depending on the architecture, the actual tools may vary&ndash;but Play&rsquo;s Scala JSON API provides a giant toolbox to pull from.G: What are some of your favorite uses of Play&ndash;your own, and those of other developers?JW: I use Play for all of my apps now.  But my favorite (and typical) use is for Single Page Applications that expose JSON on the back-end and have a JavaScript front-end.G: What will Play 3.0 look like?JW: Good question!  I&rsquo;m not sure yet.  At this point we&rsquo;ve only thought through Play 2.3 and are in more of an incremental mode for the time-being. (The Roadmap is public.) We have some big ideas we are brainstorming for 3.0, but there isn&rsquo;t anything firm yet.Thanks, James!

        "excerpt": "By Gilt Senior Software Engineer Lukasz Szwed“Scala testing systems have also stepped out on their own and created some of the most mind-blowing testing tools found in any language.” &ndash;Daniel Hinojosa, author of Testing in ScalaAt Tuesday’s Dublin Scala Users Group meetup, organized by Gilt, I presented a tech talk on standard test-driven development practices available to Scala developers. These include ScalaTest, specs2, ScalaCheck, and various mocking frameworks. The event was great: we kicked things off with wood-fired pizza and a very good selection of beers. As for my presentation? Well, I noticed that many of you couldn’t make it, so I’ll share some of the highlights.I started things off by introducing ScalaTest and specs2, which share a few things in common:both are written in Scalaneither provides a one-size-fits-all testing framework, but are platforms that allow for different styles of testingboth offer great support for pending test casesthey’re mature and production-readythey’re well-integrated with sbt both borrow ideas from Cucumber&ndash;the first framework that truly showed how business professionals and other non-developers could write feature descriptions without using source codeAbout that last point: Cucumber is written in and for Ruby. For Java, very few tools exist that enable Test-Driven Development (TDD), BDD (Business-Driven Development), DDD (Design-Driven Development), or ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development), much less make those processes fun. Experienced Java programmers know and have decent unit tests for our code&ndash;but working with tests written in JUnit or TestNG is brittle and tedious, and the test code does not look as modern as Scala code does. Also, neither JUnit nor TestNG offers ways for non-programmers to create tests. Writing tests in or specs2 can help you turn old-but-good JUnit/TestNG code into actively used assets and eliminate the need for documentation. And that’s fun!ScalaTestBuilt by Bill Venners, ScalaTest integrating the best aspects of Cucumber while offering deep integration with JUnit and TestNG and lots of flexibility when it comes to scaling. At Gilt, we have learned that switching contexts between languages and frameworks isn’t always the best or most efficient approach, so we use ScalaTest for all of our tests: unit tests, functional tests, Selenium tests, and performance tests. Even though Play Framework&ndash;which we use and love&ndash;comes with specs2 support by default, we have replaced it with ScalaTest in order to make testing simple and consistent across all of our systems. As Linus Torvalds&ndash;the father of the Linux kernel&ndash;says, “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” Here is extremely simple test case, written in good-old JUnit style but presented in the ScalaTest framework:import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitSuite",

More about the talk:Handlebars is a &ldquo;logicless&rdquo; templating language. Fed up with bloated JSPs, we wanted to experiment with rendering more of Gilt&rsquo;s customer-facing web experience client-side. Handlebars.js was the perfect fit for the browser, but we thought, &ldquo;how can we leverage this on the server-side?&rdquo; What follows is the tale of how an intrepid front-end engineer, versed in JavaScript and Ruby, began his journey into Scala. This talk will discuss Scala Parser Combinators and the challenges of bridging programming language paradigms.

An excerpt:Engineers by trade think differently than non-engineers, and when we as engineers relegate ourselves to a bit more doing and not as much thinking about what we’re doing, we do ourselves and the company a disservice. For instance, engineers are obsessed with automating things. I had an engineer who called himself lazy, and it sounds like a derogatory term, but he was actually complimenting himself. He would never do anything manually because he would automate everything that he had to do. Technology companies, like Google or Facebook, or companies that are very engineering-led, are making different decisions than if it was line of business-led. One of the things I’m trying to do is to bring some of that to a company that doesn’t necessarily look from the outside like a technology company.

        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",
        "tags": "Groc frontend automated documentation",
        "excerpt": "After reading Gilt Senior Software Engineer Kevan Davis&rsquo; post on Groc, a fork of Jeremy Ashkenas&rsquo; Docco documentation generator, some of you emailed to ask us how to enable block comments. We reached out to Groc creator Ian MacLeod to see if we could all work together on publishing a new version. Ian accepted our proposal, and added Kevan and Lead Software Engineer Eric Shepherd to the Groc project. Click here to check out the latest version, Groc 0.6.0. (Thanks, Ian!)In updating Groc, we collaborated with several other people (most notably Stephan Jorek) and did about two dozen pull requests&ndash;bringing in block comments, doc tags (both mentioned in our previous post), code folding (a new feature), and, of course, a slew of bug fixes and tweaks and polish. Going forward, we will publish regularly&ndash;using Semantic Versioning as a guide for our version numbers.To get some perspective on Groc and its origins, I asked Ian why he created it. &ldquo;Initially, I was just looking for some additional functionality for Docco&ndash;specifically, better support for projects organized into multiple directories,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;However, those changes added quite a bit of complexity to Docco, and Jeremy preferred to keep Docco simple. So I went my own way (a fresh start allowed me to be more free structuring my own tool, and was also a great excuse to explore some of my other side ideas).&rdquo;In the documentation for Groc, Ian discusses literate programming as the methodology he chose when developing his project. Over the course of building Groc, he says, &ldquo;my opinion about literate programming changed drastically.  With Docco as my introduction to it, I viewed literate programming purely as an interleaving of comments with source.&rdquo; As an author of a &ldquo;literate programming tool,&rdquo; he thought it wise to study up on the subject, and &ldquo;devoured&rdquo; Donald Knuth&rsquo;s Literate Programming. His conclusion: &ldquo;Wow, what an over-complex and dated mess it is!&rdquo;Ian explains:As defined by Knuth, literate programming is about writing documentation that can be transformed into code.  After all, his motivation was to be able to publish his projects as books.  His literate programming tools were effectively meta-programming tools: your documentation defined macros and snippets of source; tangle would read that and spit out generated source, while weave would take the same input and spit out generated documentation. I very quickly formed the opinion that the &lsquo;pure&rsquo; literate programming approach was not very compatible with current trends and projects.  However, the spirit of literate programming is eminently applicable to code from any era: Source code should be written such that it is easily understood by and organized for humans.  Most code you see today is written for the machine first, human second. In practice, this means you apply a few methodologies (that differ from traditional source writing):Source code should be grouped by concept, much as you&rsquo;d group content for a reference book. This applies at many levels (file and directory organization, sections within a file, method grouping within a class, etc).For example, the file structure of a Rails project is the antithesis of logical grouping.  Files for each concept are strewn throughout the project (very consistent naming, and easy for a machine; but not always friendly to the human).  LP can mean more work for tools.Or, within a class definition: it is common to see methods grouped by their visibility; whereas it is often much clearer to the human if public methods and the private helpers they call are grouped more closely together.Source should have a narrative.When method documentation talks about optional behavior; those comments should be located with the code that implements that optional behavior. In practice, this often means heavily reorganizing conditional logic and adopting a flat style (avoid nested conditionals).Similarly, the file/directory organization should try to minimize the amount of seeking that someone needs to perform in order to understand the source. They should be able to, ideally, read straight through the files in some order.As for the inspiration for Groc, Ian recalls having a &ldquo;very long&rdquo; brainstorming session of names that seemed similar to Docco (it being the inspiration), but different enough to not confuse people. &ldquo;At some point I combined 'doc&rsquo; and 'grok,&rsquo; and it stuck as a fantastic name: you want to grok your source and documentation, after all.&quot; ",

        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",
        "tags": "Mobile development gilttech Appium",
        "excerpt": "Just a few years ago, mobile purchases made barely a dent in Gilt’s revenues. Today, mobile represents more than 40 percent of our sales, and will soon reach 50 percent. With so many of our customers interacting with us through their mobile devices, it’s imperative that we offer them a stable and enjoyable shopping experience. One bad bug can drive away customers for good.Given the increasing importance of mobile to our business, and therefore the need to expand the number of teams that can contribute to our mobile applications, the Gilt mobile team has been hard at work improving and streamlining our testing processes. This post will describe our automated testing efforts, the technologies we use, and what lies on the horizon—both for us, and for the automation tools we use.Testing at Gilt: A Brief OverviewIn the early days of Gilt Mobile, none of our testing was automated. This was workable at the time because only one team&ndash;the mobile team&ndash;worked on the applications. We followed a fairly simple development cycle, as follows:Our crew of mobile engineers would implement a series of new features, as determined by product management. Known issues would be prioritized by severity, and fixed accordingly. We would internally release versions of the application for testing purposes on a regular basis. An overseas team of testers performed high level feature testing, regression testing, and other testing not covered by engineering during development. The QA team would be responsible for the testing of new features, stress-testing the app in an effort to find new issues and performing of a suit of sanity tests to make sure that basic app functionality remained intact. Once QA gave the go-ahead, we’d sign the build appropriately and submit to the iOS App Store.As mobile has become more critical to the business and more teams have started to contribute to our mobile applications, QA has become increasingly important—particularly in iOS, where we concentrate most of our development efforts. With an increasing install base, more contributors, and more features, comes increased complexity. Ensuring that the app is issue-free when we submit to the App Store for approval has become more important than ever.Understandably, the performance on mobile has generated a lot of excitement within Gilt. This has led to increased emphasis on mobile development within Gilt tech in general. We’re starting to see increased involvement from engineers on other teams, and having a loosely defined development process makes it difficult for newcomers to get up to speed and contribute to our efforts. How can we help them? With well defined process and a dash of automation!Our Development Process TodayWe’re gradually migrating to more of a test-driven workflow. We still depend very heavily on manual QA, but this is now supplemented by a suite of automated tests. Our development process is increasingly starting to look like this:Developers are encouraged to write tests for their current features and fixes.Instead of hand-building test releases at random, we now have Jenkins performing nightly builds.Builds are followed by a run of functional tests.Generated test reports are delivered to all team members, and can give detailed information on exactly where and how a failure occurred.The intent is to free up QA from having to do repetitive and time-consuming sanity tests, which allows them to focus on testing new features and find issues before our users do.The automated test framework we started with was KIF: Keep It Functional. Maintained by Square, KIF is quite mature. Using KIF was something of a proof of concept for us&ndash;more of a first step toward getting our automated testing situation under control. As such, we didn’t go through the exercise of writing an entire sanity test suite, but instead produced a couple short tests of basic functionality.What we like about KIF: Tests run in the same process as the app, and so have access to notifications. This is pretty handy when testing asynchronous parts of your app. What we don’t like: it’s heavy on private and undocumented accessibility APIs. There may be some disagreement on how big a deal this is, but Apple’s under no obligation to keep these APIs consistent, and can do away with KIF dependencies without notifying anyone&ndash;which would make things pretty difficult to fix. Setting up KIF with Continuous Integration&ndash;while not impossible&ndash;could be easier.Lately we’ve been trying out Appium, a tool we started exploring after one of our engineers learned about it at this year’s Selenium conference in Boston. Appium is built on top of UIAutomation: a framework, provided by Apple as part of Instruments, that enables you to interact with apps programmatically. We’ve used UIAutomation quite a bit in test prototyping and debugging. So, Appium doesn’t use any private APIs or resort to any cloak-and-dagger hackery to get the job done. Great! But that’s only the start of how Appium captured our attention. Appium is built on the idea that testing native apps shouldn’t require including SDKs or recompiling your app. You should be able to use your prefered test practices, frameworks, and tools.Appium is able to achieve all this by implementing a large portion of the Selenium JSON wire protocol, and essentially translating these calls into sets of native framework commands&ndash;UIAutomation and uiautomator, for iOS and Android respectively. It’s really this aspect alone that has us hooked. Our Web team has been down this path before, and has already built out a testing infrastructure revolving around Selenium, Scala, and ScalaTest. Using Appium has allowed us to take advantage of large chunks of our preexisting work. No reinventing the wheel, and no learning the hard way. This also provides us with a nice entry point for other Gilt engineers interested in working on mobile.While it didn’t take long for us to get up and running with Appium, I still can’t say that it suits the needs of  everyone out there building apps. Smaller teams with no Selenium experience or existing infrastructure might feel a little more comfortable sticking with something like KIF or Calabash.Can we do better? (Always)Like everything else, Appium isn’t perfect. Areas where Appium could benefit from significant improvement:For us, the Appium XPath engine is quite limited, and can only evaluate simple XPath expressions. It might be nice to see Appium use something like Cameron McCormack/Yaron Naveh’s  XPath parsing package for node.Another, more minor gripe is that tag names used on the web don’t correspond with their mobile equivalents in Appium. For example, a text field on the web has the tag name “ input.” Appium calls these tags either “textfield” or “UIATextfield,” which brings us to another issue&hellip; I say “either,” because doing something like driver.findElementsByTagName(“textfield”).getTagName() returns “UITextField.” Nothing shocking here, but perhaps the tag name we search for and the tag name returned should be the same thing? The good news is that development activity on Appium is really high, and its (notably friendly) community is rapidly addressing its shortcomings. You developers out there who are looking for projects can always get involved in fixing some of this stuff. Some of us on Gilt’s mobile team have recently put some fixes into Appium.Final Thoughts At Gilt, we’re trying to create a culture that promotes a proactive approach to testing. For now we’re focused on taking a load off of the QA team by automating UI testing. Gradually we’ll move on to integration testing. Long-term, we’d like to adopt a TDD-centric workflow, with developers creating tests from the outset, and taking responsibility for test maintenance.While frameworks like OCUnit and UIAutomation are relatively well documented, it doesn’t seem like any heavy emphasis has been placed on testing as a part of the development cycle. The tools are provided, but not evangelized. Fortunately, this is changing. Xcode 5 will feature some terrific test and automation centric enhancements such as XCTest, and the Bots Continuous Integration system. KIF is revamping its API with KIF-Next to get in line with Xcode 5 and take advantage of its new features. And Selenium 3, which is in the spec stages, appears set to become a tool for user-focused automation of mobile and web apps. All-round, the future for automation and testing native mobile apps is looking brighter.",

That was the takeaway of “Trust: The Secret to Scaling a Tech Organization,” the presentation Gilt co-founder and CTO Michael Bryzek gave yesterday at the Surge conference in National Harbor, MD.By focusing on execution and empowerment, Gilt has grown its team from zero to 1,000 employees in just a few years. In the process, we’ve cultivated a culture that emphasizes trusting people to follow the right course of action. This means that anyone can post to the tech blog, throw a party (as long as there’s money left in the budget!), and experiment with cutting-edge technologies that aren’t currently part of our stack. To keep projects and innovation moving forward, we use key performance indicators that measure our progress. Click here to view slides from the talk.Surge, organized by OmniTI, is one of the top scalability and performance conferences in the world. This year&rsquo;s Surge featured some excellent companies&ndash;including Spotify, Box, Fastly and AppNexus&ndash;as well as a variety of promising start-ups and enterprises. Among the many highlights was Message Systems CTO Alec Peterson’s presentation on &ldquo;Messaging at Scale.” Peterson described his company’s messaging ecosystem and how they built a massively parallel, event-driven system to manage two-way communication around email. Much of what he talked about lined up with the design of our own push notification system (apn), which was some nice validation for us.The biggest highlight of all, however, was getting to Surge’s engaged, knowledgeable audience. During the post-presentation Q&amp;A, audience members asked Bryzek lots of questions about the mechanics of KPIs, the organizational transition to our current team structure, our peer-to-peer budgeting experiment, anti-fragility, and other topics. Their enthusiasm and interest in what we do at Gilt was energizing and inspiring. Thanks again to OmniTI and its partners for inviting us to participate!",

        "category": "",
        "tags": "Handlebars.Scala Scandalbars Handlebars.js",
        "excerpt": "If you rely on SEO, which really means that you rely on robots, you still want client-side app experiences. Handlebars.scala can help you get there. Handlebars.scala—also known around Gilt Tech as Scandlebars, and sometimes Scandalbars—is a Scala implementation of Handlebars: an extension to and superset of the Mustache templating language. It began as an attempt to learn Scala and to experiment with Scala’s Parser Combinators in order to get Handlebars.js templates working in Scala. These days, it forms a critical part of our stack.The Genesis of Handlebars.scalaAt Gilt, we rely on SEO for a not-insignificant amount of revenue. This means that, at some point, a robot/crawler makes a request against Gilt’s server, and the server has to return HTML. This is how most web pages have been made. In recent years, the paradigm has shifted toward web applications that use client-side template rendering techniques—i.e., single-page apps. These applications are faster than the old technologies allowed, and offer a snappier user experience. The idea behind a single-page app is that you can offload much of the HTML rendering to the client—and you do that through a templating language. Handlebars is one of those templating languages.At Gilt, we were trying to solve two problems: to render HTML pages server-side, but also get rich client-side rendering—a “best of both worlds” scenario to address the client-server disparity, and create a way to easily share UI pieces as a JVM library.We had experience with server-side templating engines like Java Server Pages (JSP), which has its own nuances, as well as client-side, JavaScript templating engines like Handlebars. With both of these, you end up duplicating logic—and our goal was to economize on server-side rendering and reduce the duplication. Our question: How can we make server-side rendering low-barrier enough without duplicating too much of our efforts in client-side rendering?We Tried MustacheWith this question in mind, we checked out Mustache. A logic-less templating language, Mustache offers a considerable benefit: It’s language-agnostic and offers several implementations for all programming languages, including Scala. After experimenting with Mustache, however, our UI Architecture team realized that it’s really terse. Because of its logic-lessness, Mustache is kind of a pain in the ass to write (or can be, for something as large as an ecommerce site with millions of members).After playing around with Mustache, Eric and the team were drawn to Handlebars: a superset of Mustache created by Tilde co-founder Yehuda Katz. Handlebars is very similar to Mustache, but offers a variety of extras—namely, path lookups and helper functions. It also can be pre-compiled into JavaScript. Handlebars is a crucial component of Ember.js, which Yehuda also created.Our issue with Handlebars was that we needed it to run on the JVM. When I shared this info with Yehuda’s colleague, Tilde co-founder Tom Dale, after a NYC.JS meetup, he suggested that we try out Rhino—a JavaScript interpreter written in Java. At the time, Gilt Senior Engineer Kevan Davis was trying to figure out how to run Handlebars and Rhino, and made some progress with it, but the setup was clumsy because Rhino is clumsy. “Maybe I’ll just write Handlebars in Scala,” I finally said to Tom. We were at a bar at the time, and I was a bit tipsy, but there was a “yeah, sure, do that” vibe to our conversation.The Scandal of Scandlebars: I Didn’t Actually Know Scala YetThe problem with “just writing Handlebars in Scala” was that I hadn’t messed around with Scala much. Handlebars.scala was my first Scala project. Developing it was something of an excuse to play with the language and learn it by doing. Whatever works, right?The Scala standard library includes Parser Combinators: a functional programming method to describe grammars for language. I learned how to use Parser Combinators, and how to build parsers, by studying the source code of Scalate (a set of templating languages in Scala, including Mustache). This, plus help from the denizens of Gilt’s Scala 2.9.1 chat room, helped me to create Handlebars.scala.Handlebars’ preference for JavaScript (a dynamically typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions) made writing it in Scala (a statically-typed, hybrid-oriented language) pretty interesting from a bridging-concepts perspective. There’s just all kinds of syntactic quirks with Scala—for example, [Option] and how to make Option—or any monad—work.In developing Handlebars.scala I faced a number of philosophical questions:How do you write idiomatic Scala and still have it make sense?How should Options work?How does the collection library work?How can you leverage case and pattern matching so that you can achieve what you want in Handlebars by using Scala that you’re already familiar with (the idea being that any Scala object should be able to fit into a Handlebars template)?How Handlebars.scala WorksI think the key thing that makes Handlebars.scala work is the idea of view models. On the Scala side, in our server, are intelligent, intermediary layers that we can use to render a Scala/Handlebars template or serialized into JSON in order to render them using Handlebars.js.Here’s an example of the apply method of a Handlebars instance, which should be familiar to Scala fans. Apply takes an optional second argument: a Map of helper functions. The signature for apply looks like this:def apply[T](context: T, helpers: Map[String,Helper[T]] = Map.empty[String,Helper[T]])A few things to note when using Handlebars.scala:Implicit conversions will not work in a template. Because Handlebars.scala makes heavy use of reflection. Bummer, I know. This leads me to……Handlebars.scala makes heavy use of reflection. This means that there could be unexpected behavior.Method overloading will behave in bizarre ways.There is likely a performance penalty. I’m not sophisticated enough in the arts of the JVM to know the implications of this.How does Handlebars.scala perform?We’ve been using Scandlebars in production, and it’s become a crucial part of our rendering stack. We use it wherever we have a user interface that needs to be represented both the server and the client. Handlebars.scala gives us this choice to render it immediately or at a later date.Some specific examples of Handlebars.scala at Gilt:Our new unified nav (built entirely with Handlebars.scala)We have lots of small applications that don’t all use the same technologies, but we need them to be able to share a user interface as a library. Scandlebars enables us to make these HTML pieces as a library Our product detail pages SearchWith those last two items, the idea was that the same template we use to render a product on a server can be used to render it on the client. This reduces duplication by a not-inconsequential amount. What the client can do is say, “I know how to render this thing. Now, I know I’m not a robot—I’m a user using JavaScript—so instead of going back to the server for an HTML roundtrip, I can just go to the JSON.”The client-side app experience feels a lot faster with Handlebars.scala. We started to benchmark its performance and tried to find bottlenecks in rendering. Handlebars.scala uses a lot of reflection, so that can sometimes be a bit tricky in Scala or another statically-typed language. But overall, I think it performs pretty well. There’s always going to be an upper bound to its performance because it uses reflection.One key question I haven’t answered yet is this: When you use futures in Scala and Akka, and a Handlebars.scala template resolves that future, how do you organize your code before putting it into Handlebars.scala and make your data easily accessible through Handlebars.scala? Until I have a sure answer to that question, I don’t advise resolving futures inside of a template.Then we started trying to figure out, we have the ability to make an AST (abstract syntax stream) out of a template file. Now how do you take data and render a template. Need some way for the tree to be filled in. It raised a bunch of questionsThe Future of Handlebars.scalaGilt Software Engineer Chris “Chicks” Hicks and I have started working on the next version of Handlebars.scala—the idea being that Handlebars.js 1.0 has been released fairly recently, and now we want Handlebars.scala to meet it in terms of almost-compatibility. A key concern is how we can make using Handlebars.scala balance between feeling like the JavaScript-Handlebars but just as comfortable for Scala developers. If Handlebars.scala is too much like JavaScript, it won’t fit with the programming paradigm, but if it’s too much like Scala, then it will feel like it deviates too much from its original implementation.I have a few ideas:Make usability improvements, including the kinds of types helper functions can takeResolve the bugs with nested conditionalsMake it clearerMake the code prettierOptimize for the use cases we’ve run into in production—then we might be more comfortable opening it up to larger useMake sure the concept of sharing templates works and is really solidIf you use Handlebars.scala or have any additional ideas for improvements, I’d love to hear them—just contact me via GitHub.",

        "excerpt": "It&rsquo;s well known that code review is an important tool for improving quality, and we use Gerrit extensively at Gilt for that purpose. But there are also some less obvious benefits of such tools.With a system composed of hundreds of small services, applications, database schemas, libraries, and toolsets&ndash;each hosted in its own Git repository&ndash;maintaining certain standards across all of them is essential, but challenging. We may want to ensure that a certain configuration or other metadata is provided by each repo, for example. Or we might want to strongly encourage application developers to update a core library. Our tools for bootstrapping a new repository help us to make sure that current standards are followed, but it&rsquo;s easy for existing repositories to get out of date.This is where Gerrit comes in: it becomes possible to run scripts against all of our repositories that propose a change of this sort then submit it to the owners of the repository to review. It would be irresponsible to blindly make such automated changes to all of our systems, and one individual can&rsquo;t realistically review every single repository&ndash;but by distributing the burden of the reviews out to the people most familiar with the system in question, we solve both of these problems.Of course, there&rsquo;s one prerequisite to doing this type of thing, which is that you need to know who the right people are to review changes to a given repository. We have a standard for this: a reviewers.yml file in the repository containing the information, and a Gerrit hook that adds reviewers to all new patch sets based on the contents. Now we just need to bootstrap these files with a guess at the right people. To do this, I ran the following shell script a couple days ago (for simplicity, I&rsquo;ve elided a few unimportant details):for project in `gg-gerrit-ls-projects`; do    gg-gerrit-clone $project || continue    cd $project",

        "excerpt": "How did you get to Gilt?I grew up in the Bay Area, and for the majority of my career I’ve worked in Silicon Valley. Upon reflection&ndash;because I don’t think it was a conscious or deliberate choice&ndash;my career has followed a thread: technology, fashion, and ecommerce. Three years ago, I moved from the Bay Area to NYC. In considering places where I might work, I focused on ecommerce because I knew it was something I was passionate about. Tell us how you got into user experience.Years ago, I basically got into what was then called Information Architecture. A lot of people see IA as the genesis of what eventually became User Experience. At the time, the company I was working for began to embrace the Internet&ndash;first for employee communications, then for commerce. I taught myself a little HTML, a little graphic design, and invented the Web Designer position at the bricks-and-mortar retailer where I was working. That experience became my first exposure to ecommerce, and I&rsquo;ve been hooked ever since. It was at an agency where I got to truly specialize in IA as a discipline, and that catapulted me into UX design. Why Gilt?Gilt represented the best of what the NYC tech scene had to offer, and even today people consider us to be the leader in the flash sales space, with great leadership and talent. It’s a very attractive place to work, and I have since come to learn that it’s the people that make working at Gilt so special. We’ve attracted the best and brightest from the area and beyond because of the strength of the brand and our leadership position. We’re a great place for super-smart, motivated people to work. What was your first role here?I joined the company in 2011 as a Principal UX Designer. In addition to leading UX strategy and design for my project team, I served as a team mentor and an evangelist for UX to the rest of organization.In your two years here, how has UX at Gilt evolved?Because of our heritage&ndash;flash, a sense of urgency, curation, the gamification of shopping, the thrill of the hunt&ndash;we traditionally emphasized simplicity, speed, and fun. If you think about trying to replicate an offline sample sale, I think we delivered on those tenets. We created an experience that allowed the products we offer to take center stage and be the stars. In addition to making it super easy and quick to shop, the UX has evolved to make the Gilt experience enjoyable and engaging, to strike a balance between functionality and aesthetics, and to help you find what you love while having a good time.One of the biggest initiatives your team has worked on this year is Gilt Insider. Tell us about that.From a customer experience standpoint, our high-level goals centered on a few basic questions: How can we attract, entice and engage customers? How can we incentivize them to spend more time on our site? And how can we inspire them to consider us over the competition, and differentiate ourselves from the competition? With these questions in mind, we created Gilt Insider, which made us the first flash sale site to offer a true points-based loyalty program. Gilt Insider rewards our customers for all the ways they interact with the brand. Customers can earn points for purchasing items, referring friends, and even for just visiting the site. They can redeem their points to shop sales early, gain access to discounts and free shipping, attend exclusive events, and more.",

Ten minutes? Thirty minutes? An hour?Do I need other people to help me, or can I make progress on my own?Doing something short on my own is easy.

        "tags": "zookeeper ordasity distributedcomputing",
        "excerpt": "Let&rsquo;s face it&ndash;designing distributed systems can be tough. There&rsquo;s just no one-size-fits-all tool for creating distributed services: Every distributed application has a unique set of tolerances with regard to reliability, scalability, response time, and other performance factors. At Gilt, our toolbox for supporting distributed service development includes Apache ZooKeeper, RabbitMQ, Kafka and a smattering of distributed data stores. We made these technology choices based on years of hands-on development at Gilt, decades of cumulative experience across our engineering team and (literally) endless internal debate. By no means are Gilt engineers restricted to using the tools listed above, but most of us stick to using them because together they provide a solid foundation upon which to build a variety of solutions. ZooKeeper in particular has proven to be a fantastic tool for synchronizing distributed systems. For synchronizing data across nodes, it provides a set of APIs with simple and understandable behaviors, which leaves less room for misinterpretation. It also allows engineers to avoid getting bogged down by the common bugs and race conditions inherent to distributed synchronization. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with ZooKeeper, you should check it out.In our experience, we&rsquo;ve found that the most common synchronization tasks boil down to either agreement between nodes, or serializing work. To address these use cases, we use two tools built on top of ZooKeeper: Leader Election and Partitioning.Leader ElectionIt&rsquo;s almost as if ZooKeeper had been designed with Leader Election in mind. In fact, its Recipes Page outlines common Leader Election logic. The common use case is choosing a master node among a set of peers to be responsible for certain decisions. Most implementations will also promptly elect a new leader when necessary. At Gilt, we use a straightforward flavor of Leader Election written by Eric Bowman, our VP Architecture. (Unfortunately, we have not open sourced it at this time, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have much difficulty designing your own flavor of Leader Election based on the ZooKeeper recipe.)To understand how ZooKeeper helps turn a complex task like Leader Election into a relatively trivial exercise, a brief explanation is needed. It&rsquo;s easiest to imagine ZooKeeper as providing a remote filesystem. You can add and remove &ldquo;znodes&rdquo; (akin to files), query znode contents, or watch znodes. A znode can be created ephemerally, such that when the node that created it disconnects, the znode is removed. Clients can also &ldquo;watch&rdquo; znodes and receive notifications when znodes are removed. When these two features are combined, you have the beginnings of a powerful distributed synchronization system.If Leader Election sounds like the solution to your problem, check out Apache Curator. It&rsquo;s a fairly new project with reference implementations for many common ZooKeeper tasks.Partitioning with OrdasityPartitioning is a bit more complicated than Leader Election. Luckily, the folks at Boundary have created Ordasity, a fantastic solution built on ZooKeeper.The idea behind partitioning is that some universe of work needs to be done, and you want to fairly assign that work to the available nodes. One type of &ldquo;work&rdquo; can be a set of incoming requests, such that each request will be serviced by one of the nodes. &ldquo;Hmm&hellip;&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;Why is this better than using a basic load balancer?&rdquo; Answer: It can be a lot smarter!Posit that each request may represent an unpredictable quantity of work. Using Ordasity, you can track how much actual work is assigned to each node and intelligently assign incoming work to the least busy node. In essence, Ordasity enables load balancing based on computational complexity, not requests.But Wait! There&rsquo;s More&hellip;An even more interesting use for partitioning with Ordasity involves segmenting a universe of known work. This is conceptually similar to database sharding. The nodes use Ordasity to divide the universe of known work among themselves. Each time a node is added or removed, Ordasity rebalances the work, ensuring that the universe is fully and discretely assigned.Partitioning with Ordasity has simplified some of our systems by allowing us to impose the requirement that each unit of work is to be handled by, at most, one node at a time. Without this guarantee, we&rsquo;d need an additional database for synchronization.Below is a simplified example of how to use Ordasity to divide up work:import com.twitter.common.zookeeper.ZooKeeperClientimport com.boundary.ordasity.{Cluster, ClusterConfig, SmartListener}import java.util.concurrent.{ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, TimeUnit, ScheduledFuture}import java.util.{HashMap, TimerTask}",

        "excerpt": "Roland Tritsch is Gilt&rsquo;s VP Infrastructure Engineering. Infrastructure Engineering works to ensure 100% uptime, while allowing Gilt to iterate and innovate as fast as possible. Roland has more than 20 years of industry experience in various technical leadership roles and is probably the oldest member of Tech who writes Scala code (nickname: Papa Roland). If he is not behind the keyboard, he’s riding his folding race bike (other nickname: Bumblebee) through the Wicklow Mountains of Dublin, Ireland.How long have you been at Gilt?For two-and-a-half years&ndash;since April 2011.And how long have you lived in Ireland?For eight years. I’m not Irish, though&ndash;I’m German.Which is why your name isn’t “Roland O’Tritsch”&ndash;It’s actually Roland McTritsch, with an M-C. Not Roland MacTritsch&hellip;Thanks for the clarification! So, when did you decide that Gilt was the place for you?At some point during the interviewing process&ndash;I felt there was a lot of passion for good software engineering here. It was the experimentation, the appreciation for excellence, and the willingness to not be afraid to question conventional wisdom. “Let’s do it this way”&ndash;well, why? If you cannot come up with a good answer, maybe there’s a different and better way.What makes Gilt unique from other companies where you’ve worked?For me, Gilt is the biggest experiment in next-generation software engineering practices that I’ve ever seen. That means, for instance, that in the last two years (I would say) half of my experience about how to do software engineering, and how to run a software engineering organization, has been questioned. And I like that.Just in terms of software engineering practices, for instance, I like what we do in terms of decentralizing decision-making and empowering individuals. A lot of companies have tried it. There’s a risk when you do things as we do them, because people make mistakes. You have to compartmentalize the impact if something goes wrong. And we are well on the way to figuring out how to make this happen.It seems that, to decentralize decision-making successfully, a certain level of maturity is required of the organization and the people in it.It is a question of maturity, but also a question of process, approach, culture, and philosophy, because you just have to have experience and awareness of what decentralization means. What it comes back to, and what I like, is that we want to make engineers feel safe and secure, so that they get aggressive with the experimentation and the innovation.An example: when I started here, we had one gigantic EC2 account. For that account we had centralized management with a couple of people being responsible for it. People were afraid to do anything with the account and always asked for help to get something done. It was out of concern that, if something went wrong, it would affect a lot of people. We now have a system in which people who have access to EC2 get their own account and can do whatever they like with it. And that has created a very good situation where people feel safe and secure, because if they make a mistake it’s only affecting them and no one else.You have a tagline: “All Operations &amp; Zero Waiting.” What does that mean?The main promise of “All Operations &amp; Zero Waiting” is that, in the next six to twelve months, we will have created a situation in which every Gilt engineer can actually do operations, write a service and experiment, test something, prove something, or whatever else they need to do to get their jobs done, and there will be zero waiting. If you want, you’ll be able to sit down one evening, write the service, deploy it into production, and, two days later, have data that will either prove or disprove your idea. That would be awesome, and you won’t need to ask anyone or wait for anything.When did you come up with this tagline?I invented it around the time I took the job here&ndash;it came from the industry concept of “no operations.” Basically, some people claim that they can run an ecommerce business with no operations&ndash;they can be engineering-only. From my point of view, this creates the totally wrong impression that you don’t need operations. I think what “no operations” people actually want to express is that everybody can do operations&ndash;therefore, “all operations.” You want to demystify operations and take away the fear.How do you take away that fear?It comes back to the question of compartmentalizing. A lot of people don’t like to touch our production environment because if they do it wrong, they’ll bring the site down. The interesting idea we started developing about a year ago is that software systems are brittle for exactly the same reason: mutability. Changes happen, and changes in a software system can have unintended side effects. When you think of functional programming, one of the big values it offers is immutability.We are going to apply the concept of immutability to configuration management and deployment management, which means that after you have deployed a service on a container it will never change again. If you want deploy a new service you will spin up a new container and deploy the new version of the service onto that container and shut down the old one. Instead of CRUD, we are doing CRD (no U).How does compartmentalization of our platform work?For us, always going forward with freshly configured containers is a much more robust and stable concept. Also, in our system you can undo easily, and within one minute, you can roll back to the previous version and undo your mistake. We’ve created this system through a combination of Galactica (a family of services that allocates containers via CloudStack, allows for provisioning of other services, and implements a meta-data model) and Ion-Cannon, a project we’re running as a continuous deployment platform.Why did we create our own continuous deployment platform instead of using Bamboo or some other existing platform?Other platforms don’t give us the flexibility we want and need in our continuous deployment, or allow for integration with Scala. Ion-Cannon brings our built-in environment, SBT, and Jenkins environment together, and is Scala-based.How did this approach originate?About year ago, we saw an inspiring talk by [Clojure creator] Rich Hickey on the value of immutability. Then we had an infrastructure summit in Dublin, and during that summit we came up with the idea to apply the concept of immutability to configuration management and deployment management. That means that, going forward, if something is in production, we’ll never change anything. You’ll put a service into production with a given version, and we’ll start our container just for that one service. We configure it, deploy the service, start it, run it, and never update it again. If you need a service change, or another type of change, you’ll need to bring up a new container, deploy a new version of the service, and then can either kill the old one or run it in parallel.This keeps things constantly rolling forward, and eliminates CRUD. We only create and delete, we never update. So whatever is deployed in production is immutable. And that takes away a whole slew of problems, in terms of how to test, manage or configure something.How is our way different from the method other companies follow?The way many companies run is that, in production, they have an auto-configuration thingie that constantly changes the state of their system. There are software solutions to do this (Puppet, Chef), but it makes it very hard to make predictions about the state of your system. It’s also very hard to test. Roll-outs can fail on machines that aren’t configured the same way as on the test machines.What are your goals for the next six months?What I mainly want to do is roll out Galactica to the engineering organization. That means that our engineers will be able to put services into production without any intervention from the outside. They’ll be able to touch the website directly, but the automation process will ensure that they can only roll out their changes to a subset of our member base. And if something goes wrong, the impact will be limited. I want to create this feeling of safety, that to try and fail is okay.How do you make this happen? What is your management philosophy?I believe in the power of &ldquo;why&rdquo;! I ask myself a lot why I am doing what I am doing, and why does it matter to Gilt. And I ask the people around me why what they do matters. Sometimes they know&ndash;and if they don’t, then I am always available to do soul-searching. Most of the time it is not very hard to connect what we do with what Gilt needs. In my case, what we do matters because it allows us to innovate, iterate and experiment faster, while maintaining a 100% uptime record. This is incredibly valuable for Gilt and, by extension, for our members. Indirectly, Infrastructure Engineering makes members happy, right?One last question: What are your thoughts on change?Change is good, but if you go about change the wrong way then you’re going to hurt yourself. It’s important to learn how to deal with the risk that comes with change rather than avoid the problem in the first place.Also: I don’t think you will always get it right the first time, or that whatever you come up with will be right forever.One of my favorite quotes is from Samuel Beckett: “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.”",

        "excerpt": "What’s your role at Gilt?I’m a software engineer who focuses mostly on front-end development, but as time goes on I’m becoming more of a full-stack engineer. My passion is front-end engineering, though&ndash;I’m most comfortable working in JavaScript and CSS.I&rsquo;m very focused on the visual side&ndash;it&rsquo;s what I like to do. I’m not the type who figures out how to design a database. I’m more interested in the interactive, &ldquo;what people see&rdquo; part.How did you arrive at Gilt?I’d been a member and shopped on the site for a while. I knew that Gilt’s Tech team was well respected, so when a recruiter contacted me I came in and interviewed, and that was that. That was in May 2010&ndash;right around the time that we started migrating our services from Ruby to Java.When did you become interested in technology?I studied computer science in college, but it was mostly all theory. When I came home one summer, I started making a website for myself. It was old-school: black with stars, and with that “under construction” gif of the man who makes the digging motion. The concept of online guest books was still somewhat new, and I found one that you could really customize; I found images of 3-D comic book characters and made it so that guests could pick one of the characters as their avatar. It was a big hit with people. That was my first foray into theming and changing things.What was the focus of the website?It was about me&ndash;teenager stuff, music I listened to. Nothing I’d want to publicize now!How did you learn front-end development?On my own. Around the time I graduated from college in 2000, I became really interested in CSS&ndash;it was just emerging. Right out of school, I started working at Razorfish as an associate technologist, using mostly Java. Even then, I found that I was more interested in trying to make things look pretty than in the straight coding part.And then the tech industry tanked.Yes, and there were no jobs to be found, especially for new college grads. I thought, ‘what should I do so that I can always have a job? Maybe I’ll become a doctor.’ I started taking pre-med classes and even got accepted into medical school, but then the tech industry started to bounce back, and I was able to find a job. That was at Wiley, and was my first front-end position.How did you bring yourself up to speed for that job?Lots of practicing at home, and mostly learning on the job. I Googled my way through it. I had the confidence because it was the passion that drove me. I loved doing front-end development, and felt like I could do it.Also, JavaScript applies a lot of the same programming concepts as Java, so adapting was mainly a matter of learning the new syntax and some best practices. By the time I got to Gilt, I was much more advanced.How has working at Gilt shaped your knowledge and expertise?It&rsquo;s a very challenging environment. In any other company, people might take the easy way. Here, we do things the challenging way. We’re very stringent on coding practices: For example, people will hound you if you use a double quote instead of a single quote.I&rsquo;ve been pushed intellectually here. When I first arrived, I hadn’t programmed in Java for years, but for one of my first Gilt projects I had to dive in and write a Java dispatcher. I was like, “what?” But I had to do it, so I just did it.How much of your work involves Scala?I’m doing some Scala programming, but not much. I took the free Scala course here and know very basic Scala syntax&ndash;though enough to know that it’s definitely prettier and more concise than Java. Functional programming is not what I studied in college, but I feel I should dive in and do it&ndash;so I have been, more and more. I&rsquo;ve been getting lots of code reviews and corrections. You just have to use your peers as guides to learn new things.Recently you and your team lead [Lead Software Engineer Kristen McGregor] spent an intensive few weeks at Mobile Bootcamp, learning iOS programming with our Mobile team. How did you get chosen for that?I volunteered! I asked Kristen if I could do it, and we both did it.What was it like to work with a different team?It was very easy, actually. The team did a one-day orientation for us, and Evan [Maloney, Mobile Principal Software Engineer] gave a presentation on what mobile is, and how to develop for it.What did you learn at Bootcamp?Well, first of all, I gained a new appreciation of how iOS development is completely different from web development. It reminds me in some ways of 1990s-era web development! I learned how our apps are created, and more about the proprietary issues involved in iOS. Since Bootcamp ended I&rsquo;ve begun a side project with Ruxy [Staicut, mobile software engineer], who’s become my mentor. It&rsquo;s an app that uses our API. I&rsquo;m learning a lot that way.How does your mentoring relationship with Ruxy work?We&rsquo;ve been having weekly, one-hour meetings. At first, we mainly talked about my app and which steps to take, but last week we started coding together; it was very hands-on, and worked really well. She’ll give me tips and show me where to find things like Objective-C tutorials.What are your goals for the next few months?I recently decided that I want to be more involved in Mobile, which coincides with our shifting focus to mobile. A few weeks ago I attended the An Event Apart conference, which was all about &ldquo;mobile first&rdquo;&ndash;and it sold me on the idea. That conference used to be more about front-end development, but now it&rsquo;s pretty UX-focused. My takeaway was that multi-device compatibility is the wave of the future; you should be able to see a website on any device.By going to Mobile Bootcamp, by having an iOS developer as my mentor, and by working on this responsive design project, I’m hoping to help get Gilt on the road to Mobile First and to inspire other engineers to join me.What are some of your hobbies?Videography, photography &hellip; I like to photograph people.Street fashion?A few years ago I did it a lot. Not so much anymore.You&rsquo;re a fashion aficionado. How has working at Gilt changed your approach to style?Nowadays I am concerned with classic pieces that will last&ndash;quality over quantity. I like 3.1 Philip Lim and Rag &amp; Bone, and recently bought a pair of Elizabeth and James shoes and an Antik Batik dress that are my current favorites. I like that in this office you can wear fancy things and people don’t look at you funny. I like dressing up for work!",

(Eric attributes it to a well-known xkcd correlation strip, but it&rsquo;s not in the picture: mouse over an image, and the wisdom will reveal itself.)Eric&rsquo;s article made me think about other common fallacies to add to his list&ndash;including one that I call &ldquo;misdirected statistical rigor.&rdquo; It strikes when misunderstood, dirty and/or poorly collected data is run through the paces of statistical analysis and then either misinterpreted or not interpreted at all. A couple of jokes to illustrate:Statistical analysis of Internet adoption in rural areas has shown a very high level of Internet usage.

        "excerpt": "Earlier this year I began working through Satnam Alag&rsquo;s Collective Intelligence in Action, a book on alligator farming. I wanted to improve my understanding of alligator farming as well as the fundamentals of data collection and mining for personalization. My work at Gilt has recently taken me in these directions, and I’d heard that this book provided a thorough overview of the topic. I’d dedicate a couple of hours every weekend to my reading, enjoying the time to learn at my own pace. But soon the weather got nicer, and I started spending more and more of my free time on the soccer field (or preparing for my soon-to-be-born twin daughters, who have since arrived). Eventually, as I got about halfway through the book, I realized that I was spending almost no time reading it and it started to collect virtual dust.Meanwhile, my colleagues at Gilt began having more serious and frequent conversations about how to provide training and learning experiences for engineers. Many of these conversations focused on very direct, structured training, such as on-site classes, tech talks, online courses, and conferences. Structured learning time such as this is extremely valuable, but there is a strong case to be made for a company to also invest in unstructured learning time for their creative talent. In his 2012 book The 20% Doctrine: How Tinkering, Goofing Off, and Breaking the Rules at Work Drive Success in Business, Wired writer Ryan Tate describes the efforts of companies like Google to inspire innovation by letting employees devote 20 percent of their time to unstructured/personal projects. As Tate’s book articulates, the 20% time allotment “is about goofing off at work, and how that goofing off can drive innovation and profit.&ldquo; Just at Google alone, &rdquo;[t]he fruits of 20 percent time include the contextual advertising system AdSense, which is Google&rsquo;s second most profitable business line, as well as Gmail,&ldquo; Tate writes. &quot;Twenty percent time also resulted in Google News, Google Reader, the Orkut social network, Google Suggest, and Google Moderator, among others.&rdquo;As a supporter of the 20 Percent doctrine, I wanted to create something that would encourage unstructured learning for the moonlighting autodidact and the noodler&ndash;those of us who prefer unstructured self-learning and who have maybe made it halfway through books on collective intelligence before planning to become parents (and whatnot). So I organized Study@4: a Friday afternoon study hall at Gilt HQ that’s pretty similar to your basic high school study hall except with music, beer, snacks, and fewer rules. Study@4 is scheduled opposite our popular, biweekly 5@4 talks that Gilt engineers have been organizing for years.How I hope Gilt engineers will spend their Study@4s:readingworking through a tutorialworking on a side-project or an open source projectreading literary classics is also okay, I suppose Every Study@4 will feature a resident on duty&ndash;someone who offers personalized guidance on issues related to their expertise, and who can also recommend reading and viewing materials. This person might be an engineer who helps peers resolve coding problems, a project manager who can help an engineer structure a task, a copywriter who offers assistance with a blog post or presentation, or anyone else who is part of the Gilt Tech world. You might be wondering why something like Study@4 is useful when you can study from your desk, or on the subway, or while driving down the FDR, or in the shower. But how often to we actually use those times to study? I am the type of person who gets caught up in the day to day, and I forget to take time to turn my attention over to my curiosity. If you are like me, then something like Study@4 can be a great opportunity to have an hour or two of quiet time to work on a non-urgent yet rewarding task. Study@4 is meant to be informal, and participation is completely optional.We just kicked off Study@4 and we’re excited to see how it changes and grows to suit the needs of Gilt Tech’s noodlers and experimenters. I hope it becomes as popular as the 5@4 presentations and that our remote offices can find ways to benefit from what is, in many ways, a big experiment from a humble noodler who wants a chance to finish an interesting book on alligator farming.Photo by Steven Beger via Creative Commons license.",

        "tags": "documentation automation frontend",
        "excerpt": "Writing great documentation is not something that comes naturally or easily to many engineers. And many companies don’t have the resources to hire a dedicated document writer. Hence the value of automated documentation, which allows you to generate, at a minimum, a basic amount of documentation quickly and cheaply.As a front-end engineer working on UI architecture, I write code that ends up being used by most of the front-end engineers at Gilt—which makes automated documentation pretty important to me. A few years ago, some of my colleagues and I checked out a variety of automated documentation tools, including JSDoc, jGrouseDoc, YUIDoc, DocumentJS, and Docco, to see if any of them both looked pretty and supported JavaDoc-style Tags. We liked Docco’s clean look, inclusion of source code alongside documentation, and acceptance of markdown, but it didn’t support Tags. JSDoc supports Tags, but we didn’t like its appearance. We just couldn’t find a tool that gave us everything we needed. In the end, we created our own automated documentation tool by forking Docco and adding (hacking) support for Tags.More recently, we conducted another survey of automated documentation tools and discovered Groc. Created by Ian MacLeod, Groc is a fork of Docco, and better than the alternatives in many ways. But Groc, like its grandparent Docco, offers no support for Tags—or block comments (WTF?)—so we forked it, too, and added (without hacking, this time) what we felt was missing. The end result is awesome. Go check it out on GitHub.But wait—what are these “Tags&quot; you speak of?You’ve probably seen Tags in block comments. They begin with an @ sign—for example, @public or @method foo or @param {String[]} names A list of names.A doc comment usually has multiple Tags as well as some free-form text, like this:/** * Sets a cookie given a value of any type. * * @method    set * @public * * @param     {String}   name               The name of the cookie to be set * @param     {Mixed}    value              The value to convert to string and set in the cookie * @param     {Object}   [options]          Options hash * @param     {Mixed}    [options.expires]  The expiration as a number of seconds, or \"session\", or undefined for one year * * @return    {Boolean}                     Whether or not the cookie was successfully set * * @example *   cookie.set('foo', 'bar', { expires : 1000000 }); *   cookie.set('foo', [1, 2, 3], { expires : 'session' }); *   cookie.set('foo', { bar : 'baz', boom : 'boosh' }); */The structure that Tags provide makes writing documentation much easier for people who aren’t that great at it. The above sample is pretty decent; if we process it using Groc (our fork), we get something even better:Documenting JavaScript is nice, but what about CSS? Or Handlebars?Absolutely! I don’t have any amazing examples of CSS/LESS/Handlebars documentation, but it should work exactly the same as for JS/CoffeeScript. Also, you don’t have to use Tags. Here’s a Handlebars template that includes some “ordinary&quot; comments:OK, that’s cool. But you said something about automating this?Having a tool that can generate documentation is all well and good, but you have to remember to actually run the tool. There’s always the risk of forgetting this step. So how about we integrate it into your build process?Let’s assume you use Grunt, a front-end build tool that has a configuration file (Gruntfile.coffee) that enables us to define tasks. (Alternatives to Grunt include Smoosh, Gear and Buildr.) Let’s create a custom task &ldquo;doc”:grunt.registerTask 'doc', 'Generate documentation', -&gt;  done = this.async()  grunt.log.writeln('Generating Documentation...')  require('child_process').spawn('./node_modules/.bin/groc', ['lib/*.js', 'README.md']).on 'exit', -&gt;    grunt.log.writeln('...done!')    done()Let’s integrate doc into our build task:grunt.registerTask 'build', ['test', 'clean:build', 'doc', 'concat', 'replace', 'uglify']Then, whenever you grunt build, you get freshly generated documentation!How do you guys use this at Gilt?We have lots of small JS/CSS modules at Gilt, and they all get published to one place: a private npm registry. Our documentation server uses Groc to generate documentation for all modules that get published. Both Groc and this server use the same stylesheets, so they look the same and provides a seamless experience.Here’s our Table of Contents, generated by our documentation server, which lists all modules, their descriptions, current versions, code coverage percentages (courtesy of Istanbul), dependencies, and has links to the groc-generated documentation (including past versions):And a sample of what Groc generates:What comes next?We’ll continue to tweak Groc to add coverage to our automated documentation tool and show which lines of code have been tested or not. We’d also like to build in a search feature that will access multiple modules. Have some suggestions on other features we should add? Email me at kdavis at gilt dot com. I’d also like to hear from anyone who uses our work—let us know if it was helpful.Note: Thanks to DailyJS for citing this post.",

Now in its second/&ldquo;2.0&rdquo; year, the Fair took place on the Times&rsquo; 15th floor and featured exhibits by the likes of Novus, the New York Public Library, Meteor, and us!Our booth focused on our use of the Play Framework&ndash;specifically, the Gilt Live page and our product pages. The technologists who stopped by to chat with us were genuinely interested in learning more about Play and the technologies we use, and several even signed up to receive information about our free training program. When we weren&rsquo;t answering people&rsquo;s questions about concurrency or free Scala classes, we got to mingle with folks from neighboring booths. Two of my favorite projects were Tabula, a data liberator that helps you conquer PDF bureaucracy with ease; and &ldquo;Best in Show&rdquo; award winner CSV Soundsystem, whose creators make electronic music based on U.S. economic data and other things:Gilt won the Dress Code Award, natch. We were also vying for the &ldquo;Swagmasters&rdquo; and &ldquo;Best Use of Ostriches&rdquo; honors, but others bested us.In addition to the featured projects, the Fair featured talks by talented Bitly scientist Hilary Mason, Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Project Director Dan &ldquo;@MayorEmanuel&rdquo; Sinker, and Haleigh Sheehan of GitHub. The crowd was an eclectic and impressive bunch: I met data scientists from Buzzfeed, the Times and Pro Publica; researchers from Columbia University; the editor of the Freakonomics blog; and an intern who solved one of her company&rsquo;s &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; archiving problems in just over three weeks. There were also fantastic views of the Hudson, googly eyes and glue sticks, and at least one creatively arranged strand of flickering holiday lights.All in all, the Open Source Science Fair was an enlightening and inspiring way to spend a few hours hanging out with NYC technologists and getting to know some of the developers and data engineers behind our nation&rsquo;s newspaper of record. Can&rsquo;t wait to see what next year&rsquo;s Fair looks like&ndash;this is one science experiment that works. Congrats to TimesOpen for putting together such a great event!",

Lucene Sugar makes it easier to:compose Lucene indexes using the familiar Scala cake patternadd indexed and/or stored fields to a Lucene documentindex collections of documentssearch! (You didn’t really expect that, did you?)My general goal for Lucene Sugar is to turn some standard operations on their head. For example, instead of:scala val doc = new Document doc.add(new StringField(\"string_field\", \"aString\", Store.YES)) doc.add(new LongField(\"long_field\", 123456L, Store.NO)) doc.add(new StoredField(\"int_field\", 10))you can now write:scala val doc = new Document doc.addIndexedStoredField(\"string_field\", \"aString\") doc.addIndexedOnlyField(\"long_field\", 123456L) doc.addStoredOnlyField(\"int_field\", 10)Lucene Sugar is still in its infancy, but I believe it already offers great value to anyone wishing to use Lucene in Scala code.Why I Created SugarGilt&rsquo;s inventory includes millions of different items in limited quantities. These items are sold quickly, which means that our inventory is constantly changing. A few weeks ago I found that I needed a data store capable of:storing items composed of text and numbersbeing indexed and filtered using extremely specific criteria (for example, all white shirts from Paul Smith that can be shipped to Canada)working quickly and efficiently (a few 100ms per query)being embeddable (I wanted the data management to be self-contained in the service without requiring any external dependenciesI&rsquo;d used Lucene for other projects, and thought it might be a great fit for what I needed. In fact, it turned out that&ndash;despite its wordy API&ndash;Lucene works very well. To overcome the excess verbiage issue, I added some &ldquo;Scala syntactic sugar&rdquo; around the Lucene API to make it more concise and pleasant to use. After doing some coding, I realized that it could be helpful to convert this higher-level API into a library that could be reused in other projects. (I also badly wanted to publish my first open source Scala project, so this was a very good candidate.)With Lucene Sugar, we can now build a search and browser service on top of our inventory data; the data is composed of textual attributes such as product name, brand, color and description as well as numeric data like price and size.

        "tags": "splitter zeusbench Riak",
        "excerpt": "In late June a few of us in NYC joined our colleagues in Gilt&rsquo;s Dublin office to test out Riak for our main user store. Every day our main user store receives upwards of 100,000 requests per minute at our peak site traffic time of 12PM. Because of these extreme traffic spikes, excellent performance of our distributed databases is a must.We also wanted to learn more about how Riak supported multiple data centers (including EC2) in an active-active-active configuration: a mechanism that guarantees continuous service in the event a database goes down. Active-active-active configurations also allow requests to be serviced in any datacenter without requiring the request to leave the data center to retrieve user information. These capabilities are quite important to Gilt, because network connections between datacenters are never as fast as those located within a single datacenter.On the hardware side, our plan was to install two rings, each consisting of five servers, in different datacenters, and then completely run Riak through the gauntlet. We had only one week to create this system. Luckily, we had the best help imaginable: Seth Thomas and Steve Vinoski from Basho, the company that created Riak.Riak passed all of our tests with high marks, and also performed well during various failure scenarios we staged.In terms of the actual testing, our goal was to duplicate our user service and point it at a Riak datastore instead of our current datastore. This, of course, required altering the service code. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the cake pattern, which in my experience results in obfuscated code, but I have to admit that&ndash;at least in this case&ndash;it simplified the code rework and made the code cleaner.After using Riak to duplicate our user service, our next step was to write some code to copy our existing users&rsquo; information to the new Riak backend. The speed of our current infrastructure enabled us to copy our entire user set to Riak during non-peak hours.Once we had everything humming in our cluster of user services and Riak instance, we began simulating reads and writes to the service as they occurred in production. To do this, we used splitter: an open source project, created by Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman, that accepts requests and forwards them to two different backends. One of the responses is kept, and the other is discarded. In this case we discarded the Riak response. We then configured our load balance (Zeus) to forward requests to the splitter instead of directly to the service. This put read traffic on our test user service.To simulate write traffic, we wrote a small bit of code to publish RabbitMQ messages any time a write or update occurred; consumed those messages on the test user service; and duplicated the write or update. Read-and-writes were now being executed against the test service cluster without putting our production system in any real danger. Testing looked good so far.To really make sure Riak was as solid as it seemed, we then decided to ramp up the read/write load. We simulated an extreme read load by using Zeusbench, which executed an extreme number of HTTP requests against our test service and provided metrics on how the service performed (you can find a number of open source alternatives to Zeusbench).  We also wrote a quick program that executed upwards of 1,500 insertions into Riak per second.  We kept the inserts going the entire time.  Read/write performance didn’t suffer, even under this amount of load.Our final test involved kill -9’ing Riak nodes and monitoring how the cluster performed.  While removing Riak nodes, we maintained production load against the service. Riak performed well during these situations.Riak&rsquo;s strong performance suggests that, should we pursue implementation, it will withstand our unique traffic needs and prove reliable. As for the Gilt-Basho team’s strong performance: It was amazing that we were able to accomplish so much in just a week’s time! Thanks again to Seth and Steve for making this possible.",

        "excerpt": "What is your role at Gilt?I&rsquo;m lead engineer for Team Galactus. (We like to give our teams abstract names that don’t refer to a particular initiative; at the time of forming Galactus, we were going through a comic book phase!) I&rsquo;m a full-stack engineer, but the vast majority of my work at Gilt is on the backend: developing shared libraries, web applications and services.How long have you been with Gilt?Just over two years.Has your role here changed over time?No, I&rsquo;ve always been a backend engineer. I&rsquo;ve done some frontend stuff with previous companies that were very small, and where you had to roll up your sleeves and basically do everything.Why do you enjoy backend development more than frontend?It&rsquo;s less like the Wild West than frontend development. You can implement clean, well-tested and reusable solutions fairly easily; it’s a lot more difficult to do that in the frontend. Frontend work often feels like one hack on top of another hack, with a third hack thrown in to work around some IE issue. And it all feels really fragile, because it&rsquo;s not statically typed. Refactoring something can be a very stressful experience! There have been a few frameworks over the years built to try to solve this problem (e.g. GWT), but it&rsquo;s still generally a more challenging environment to work in. Throw CSS into the mix, which can do some really cool, untestable stuff, and … well, you get the picture.Which technologies do you use on a day-to-day basis?Scala, Play, Handlebars (both the standard JS Handlebars and Gilt&rsquo;s own Scala implementation&ndash;fondly called Scandlebars, and written by Gilt engineer Mark Wunsch. What’s your personal strategy for learning a new technology?My inclination is always to just learn on the job. That only gets you so far, though. And when you’re working on important pieces of software, you need to be the expert in the technologies you are using. Taking time out to really learn those technologies is something I have to work hard at; it’s not something that comes naturally. My preference when I do need to learn something in detail is a good old-fashioned paper book&ndash;remember those?I recently took Martin Odersky&rsquo;s Coursera course on Scala. This was really enjoyable.Describe for us some of the projects that you’ve been working on recently.The team is currently in the process of migrating our sale listing page (the most visited page on Gilt: ~30k rpm at noon) over to a new technology stack: Play, Scala, Handlebars, and Solr. As part of that work we are building a new app and adding a lot of new code to shared libraries.We are also working to integrate Scalatest/Selenium testing into our continuous delivery framework. Continuous delivery allows us to deploy to production in minutes at any time with no manual interaction after the developer types “sbt release” on their laptop. Having really good Selenium test coverage, written using Scalatest, is a key part of that.A small side project I’ve just completed is a piece of code that allows you to build “views” of a cache. You simply provide a transformation function, and you get back a virtual cache of a different type. The views themselves can be cached (if the transformation is expensive) and you can stack them, so you can have views of views. Getting the type system to work was a bit of a mind melt, but I think the end result is pretty cool. One technology you’ve been using lately is Solr. Tell us more about that.We started using Solr to power some basic search capabilities on the site in 2011. Galactus then built keyword search using the same technology stack. We are now moving the sale listing page onto Solr&ndash;after all, a sale listing is simply a search for all products with a particular sale ID. This means that less code is required to power the site. As part of moving the listing page over, we’re really having to step up the performance of the search technology stack. It has to be scalable and really fast!What’s been your biggest accomplishment here?I’ve done a few things that I’m proud of. Early on, I think my biggest accomplishment was &ldquo;getting&rdquo; the Gilt technology stack so quickly, and being able to contribute within a few weeks of joining. I’ve since worked on some pretty core pieces of software like Commons, which is a client library for Gilt’s domain model; the sale targeting engine, which targets sales to the appropriate members; and keyword search. I also recently led the redevelopment of the product page: a complete rewrite of the old page from the bottom up.What would you say are the best parts about working at Gilt? And more specifically, about working at Gilt-Dublin?The pace&ndash;things move very fast all the time. We&rsquo;re on the cutting edge in terms of continuous delivery, the technologies we’re using, and some of the testing tools we&rsquo;re building.Also, the people. Gilt has some great people in so many different areas. I&rsquo;ve learnt more in my first two years at Gilt than I did in the previous eight years since I left college. The Dublin office, being a bit younger than Gilt NYC, feels a little more like a start-up in some ways. There&rsquo;s a really good atmosphere. Despite being the new kid on the block, we&rsquo;re solving big problems and we&rsquo;re doing great work!The actual office itself is also fantastic: A penthouse office in the city centre with great views. Plus it&rsquo;s in Dublin, the best city in the world!Can you talk a bit about mentoring and your on-the-job inspiration sources?While Gilt is using some really cool and interesting technologies, I&rsquo;m an engineer rather than a technologist, so solving problems is what makes me want to go to work each day&ndash;and Gilt has some really hard, interesting problems to solve.I&rsquo;m also lucky to work with exceptional people. This is also a great inspiration: working with people who, in pretty much every interaction I have with them, teach me something.",

        "excerpt": "The jQuery Foundation just posted video of &ldquo;If You Love It So Much, Why Don&rsquo;t You Write a Wrapper Around It?&rdquo;&ndash;my presentation at last month&rsquo;s jQuery Conference in Portland, Ore. In my talk, I focus on the importance of using consistent APIs and taking advantage of other people&rsquo;s work (in the form of third-party code) when working with a large code base. Putting a wrapper around someone else&rsquo;s code can give you the API and feature set you want, while saving you tons of tedious work writing business logic.The last time I attended jQCon was in 2010, when it was held in Boston. The conference is sponsored by jQuery, and certainly features a fair amount of jQuery-related content, but one of the things I appreciate most about it is its focus on larger-scale, front-end issues of the day. This year was no exception.Back in 2010, two major themes that emerged during jQCon were pubsub messaging and client-side templating. At that time, Gilt was somewhat behind the curve in these areas. Our front-end team came back from the conference feeling inspired and energized, and built systems to handle both pubsub messaging and client-side templating. One was Gilt.Notify, an adaptation of Peter Higgins&rsquo; pubsub plugin. The other system was Gilt.Template, which at the time was a template-engine-agnostic wrapper around client-side templating (since different teams were using different template engines). Both of these systems have evolved over time, as we&rsquo;ve normalized to one template engine (Handlebars) and added private pubsub channels that function like observers, but both are still part of our new module-based front-end stack.In 2013, we find ourselves right in line with the current state of the industry. Featured talks covered HTML5 polyfills, CSS3 animations, front-end unit testing, client-side MVC, promises, A/B testing, client-side build tools, and—as the topic of my presentation illustrates—wrapping third-party plugins and libraries. Gilt has been working on all the above over the past couple years, and it was good to know that we&rsquo;re up-to-date with the latest in front-end technology.Check out the slides here. If your window is large enough, you&rsquo;ll see at the bottom the notes I wrote to accompany the slides.",

Over lunch, Peluso answered our questions about a wide range of topics&ndash;from how to handle uncomfortable workplace situations (answer: with grace) to how she met her husband (a mutual friend). Thanks to Michelle for taking time out of her busy schedule to meet with us and share some of her story!Since late 2012, Gilt&rsquo;s women technologists have been meeting informally to discuss leadership skills, work/life balance, and professional development. Our activities include reading books either by or for businesswomen, attending public events for women in technology, and working with nonprofits that aim to create more opportunities in technology for women and girls. On July 11 we&rsquo;ll host Girls Who Code, an organization that promotes &ldquo;gender parity in the computing fields.&rdquo; More on Girls Who Code at Gilt to come in a future post!",

        "excerpt": "How did you arrive at Gilt?I first came to Gilt while I was a student at the University of Waterloo in Canada (I’m Canadian). Our school runs a program in which computer science students complete six four-month internships over five years. I did my Gilt internship from September to December 2011, during my senior year.What was your role here?I was part of the Gilt City engineering team, working as a software engineer.What was it like to be a Gilt intern?I was able to interact with a lot of senior engineers as well as the vice president of engineering, and I learned a lot about the different roles team members fulfill. My supervisors gave me direct feedback on my work, which always helped. There’s just a lot of transparency here—I was on a small team, which allowed me to gain exposure to high-level details about what was going on in the company. Working on a small team also made it easier to see how my work made sense in the big picture.How did you make your return?After I graduated from Waterloo, I decided I’d like to come back to Gilt. When I graduated I followed up with Peter Bakhirev, who had been my internship supervisor, and asked if there were any opportunities. Gilt had some job openings, so Peter and I had a conversation and I ended up coming back.While you were gone, how had Gilt or its culture changed?One thing that has been changing with Gilt City more recently is that we’re moving toward taking the lead on our tech architecture—one that’s separate from the larger Gilt tech department, but follows the same best practices. This means that there’s a lot of work that needs to be done. I think the changes are interesting because they’re helping us to facilitate more cooperation between tech and business groups, and that helps us drive business growth. We’re creating something independent for ourselves, so we can make more independent decisions.What do you like best about Gilt’s culture?What I appreciate about Gilt is that it’s very safe to bring up new ideas and receive feedback. I also like that there are no private offices. For two years I worked as an accountant doing audits and taxes, and in that industry, partners and senior staff work in private offices, so you don’t always get to interact with them. It’s just how the industry works. It’s very different here—as a tech company, everybody’s very accessible and open to having conversations with the people across the hall. It’s something I think Gilt should be proud of. Even though Gilt has become a large company, it hasn’t lost its down-to-earth quality.What are your thoughts on mentoring at Gilt?I have a one-on-one session with Peter every week or two weeks to talk about my personal development and to let him know if I’m interested in anything else outside my current list of responsibilities. There are a lot of opportunities to switch projects, so I can get exposure to all the facets of my team’s functions. You can also switch teams here, which helps you to adapt to different work and management styles.What are your career goals?My primary short-term goal is to deepen my knowledge of different technologies and improve my learning speed.And long-term?I am very interested in entrepreneurship. Before joining Gilt, I had built several websites. One of them was an online community for my school, and it ended up serving over a million views. Seeing many people using my product felt really good, and I wanted to experience that more. I then participated in an incubator, where I worked on another venture with seed funding and mentors to learn more about entrepreneurship. I hope I develop a variety of skills and build relationships here at Gilt to become a better entrepreneur.How do you think working at Gilt will help you to become a better entrepreneur?Despite its size, Gilt maintains an entrepreneurial spirit. There are a lot of experiments going on, and many decisions involve taking a lot of risks. I get to see what works and what doesn’t. It’s still a relatively young company. I think there’s a lot here for people who might want to be an entrepreneur someday—you can make lifelong connections and learn critical skills.",

My presentation covered some of the major technologies we use as part of our virtualization efforts and the rationale for our choices. Here&rsquo;s the slideshow: In addition to me and fellow Gilt Techie Danny Meidell, other speakers and attendees came from Datadog, McGraw-Hill, Red Hat and other companies. NYC DevOps requested that presentations conform to the Ignite&rsquo;s style of 20 slides in five minutes (with 15 seconds per slide). It was pretty easy to adjust to the timing requirements, and I liked the format overall because it enabled all of us to quickly learn about a number of different topics.

We have hundreds of JVM-based HTTP services interacting with each others or with backend systems such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Zookeeper, and many more third-party solutions over various data interchange formats and protocols.A few months ago, we felt we needed to get more insight into the detailed amount of traffic that was going in and out of every service or backend system. When various teams are working on new features that require more communication patterns and data exchange, it starts to be difficult to do capacity planning when you don’t know where you are.Moreover, in our experience, we have seen that most features generally go from a normal usage pattern for months to a sudden very large adoption by our business operations. The amount of data can suddenly grow 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, which does not generally go without its own set of challenges.To get better insight into the amount of data exchanged, we started the effort to monitor the data transferred out of our HTTP services (we use Jetty) using the excellent Metrics library from Coda Hale. This can be trivially done extending the existing Metrics InstrumentedHandler for Jetty:public class CustomInstrumentedHandler extends InstrumentedHandler { ",

When you develop a front end experience for mobile devices, this can become a little cumbersome because the feedback loop can sometimes feel much slower. There are emulators for your machine and browser sizing/user-agent strategies that you can employ to make your development process more efficient. But in the end, you&rsquo;re going to want to test on your devices.In this post, I&rsquo;ll explain how you can proxy your local development (localhost) to both your Android and iOS devices. When you do this, you&rsquo;ll be able to code, refresh, repeat a lot faster and more efficiently.Charles ProxyTo get started, you need a strategy to manage your HTTP proxy. I use and recommend using Charles Proxy (http://www.charlesproxy.com/) but there are certainly other alternatives. Charles Proxy is very powerful but I won&rsquo;t be going into much detail about it here. Instead, we want to set up a port that we can HTTP proxy to.If you click on PROXY, then PROXY SETTINGS, you&rsquo;ll see a menu where you can enter in a port that you would like to proxy to.

        "excerpt": "I&rsquo;m building Gilt&rsquo;s new Android app and a good portion of the website is an Android WebView. As you may or may not know, this WebView uses the default Android Internet Browser to render webpages. You probably know this app best by its logo in the lower right hand corner of this screenshot:When you use Google Chrome on the Android device, inspection is very straightforward &ndash; I&rsquo;ll cover this in a later post. But for Android Internet Browser, there is not to my knowledge a good way to inspect and manipulate the DOM.I needed to inspect the DOM because I inherited a JavaScript file that allows us to mimic scrolling events on mobile devices via webpages. The scrolling library works as expected in all other browsers on all other devices. So, I needed to better understand what was happening in the Android Internet Browser.The tool that bridged my device to an inspector tool is Adobe Inspect. To get going, you have to install 3 components:1. Adobe Inspect on your computer: http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/2. Google Chrome Extension Adobe Inspect: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adobe-edge-inspect/ijoeapleklopieoejahbpdnhkjjgddem?hl=en3. Google Play Store Adobe Inspect: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.shadow.android&amp;hl=enOnce you have installed everything, connect your Android device to your computer and make sure you&rsquo;re on the same WiFi. On your Android Device, open Adobe Inspect and click the plus sign in the upper-right hand corner to get to this screen:Get your ip address from your computer and enter it in Adobe Inspect on your Android Device. If you skip ahead, you can find your ip address on your computer by opening Google Chrome and clicking on the Adobe Inspect icon in the nav bar &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see it there as well.

        "excerpt": "At Gilt we try to move as fast as we can getting code - be it fixes or awesome new features - to production as quickly and safely as possible. Sometimes we make mistakes, and, today was such a day. Around noon, a commit on one of our flagship applications ran riot: allocating native threads; consuming memory and CPU; and bringing down all other applications collocated on the same set of servers. Our customers were affected and for this the tech team at Gilt are truly sorry. There have been a ton of tweets from concerned members, and we were keen to explain what went wrong.Some interesting things arose in the aftermath of this outage (we take all our outages very, very seriously). First and foremost, this was largely a people problem: our process around code-review and performance testing failed - a commit that was not fully peer-reviewed was moved to production, and deployed -after- our morning performance run. Under normal load, everything looked ‘just fine’ - under our noon rush, everything fell apart. I estimate there’s about a 60% chance that a good code-review would have caught the issue - however, I’m 99.999% confident that our rigorous load tests would have caught the issue. We use Gerrit for code review, and have automated load tests every morning; this was a late change for which we were hoping to gather some real life data related to load - ironically to debug a smaller performance issue we’ve been seeing in one of our applications - and we rushed the change.A positive we can take out of this as a tech organization is that we already have a number of initiatives in progress at Gilt that will prevent this kind of thing from happening. The more we use code-review, the more we see opportunities to automate the veracity of any release: you can imagine a script that says “this release contains a commit that was not reviewed and was +2’d by the author - abort!”. From a performance perspective, we’re working on incorporating performance testing into a continuous integration system we call ‘ION Cannon’; again, any release would be performance tested and rolled back automatically. These are areas where we can take human error out of the process, and I know that I (as the engineer who didn’t run the load test) am keen that we double our efforts in this regard. One of the other things we’re doing is making all of the applications that run gilt.com smaller and more isolated, an initiative we call ‘LOSA’ (Lots of Small Apps). LOSA is the mantra that lets us break up some of our large web applications into smaller chunks. The outcome? Stronger ownership of each part of gilt.com by the engineering teams; simpler code, with better sharing of assets and commons functionality;  and, better isolation - in the event that one of our applications serving a part of gilt.com goes awry, other apps should not be impacted. Today we made a mistake - and we feel pretty bad about it. We feel good though about what we’re doing to make gilt.com better.",

        "category": "",
        "tags": "Gilt Gilttech Agile",
        "excerpt": "With teams, ingredients, initiatives and KPIsSpotify recently documented their progressive approach to scaling Agile development with a fairly large team. Gilt’s approach has many similarities, but since some Spotify best practices are Gilt anti-patterns, it’s worth a closer look.The Gilt tech team is about 100 strong. Most of our development is done in Manhattan. We’ve also got a small team in Portland, Oregon and a larger one in Dublin, Ireland.InitiativesThe cornerstone of the Gilt process is the initiative. We define an initiative as “a project we expect to work on for the foreseeable future.” Our foreseeable future is typically 3-12 months, depending on the area. An initiative might be to increase organic search traffic to the site.We work on the order of 10 initiatives in parallel. The decision to green light an initiative depends on a number of factors. The most significant factor is a mathematical model of how we expect the initiative to perform, but we also consider softer factors like direct customer happiness and innovation.Prioritizing a set of initiatives focuses the technology group on an initiative portfolio. This portfolio makes a clear statement on what is important, and indirectly, what is not. This has had a profound effect, halting our previously unending feature level prioritization discussions. This change has made not only our team happier and more productive, but also our stakeholders.Unlike Spotify, we don’t maintain a roadmap document. Our roadmap is simply the sum of active initiatives. We revisit the set of prioritised initiatives every few months.KPIsInitiatives are defined in terms of the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure them. We define two types of KPIs. Strategic KPIs measure the success of the initiative’s strategy and last as long as the initiative. Tactical KPIs measure the performance of the initiative’s tactics and come and go as tactics evolve. All tactical KPIs must drive  a strategic KPI.For example, our SEO initiative might be defined by the strategic KPI: “Number of organic visitors in the last 30 days.” If current tactics involve stimulating inbound link creation a tactical KPI might be: “New inbound links in the last 30 days.” That tactical KPI would be abandoned when the initiative no longer employed that tactic, either because the team no longer thought they could get more out of that tactic or the team discovered a new tactic that could drive their strategic kpi faster.We consider initiative mission statements an anti-pattern. “To be great at Organic search!” is simply a more subjective, and less useful denormalization of the strategic KPI.TeamsWe organize ourselves into teams (Squads in Spotify parlance) of around 4-10 cross functional members who sit together. Teams focus on a single initiative but may own others that are less active. Team members have a lot of input in selecting the initiatives their team works on.Team dynamics take a while to form and stabilize. Consequently we favor long running teams, surviving generations of initiatives. However mobility between teams is encouraged and takes two forms. Teams self-organize to swap engineers periodically to manage skills deficits or unexpected workloads, in a practice affectionately called “horse trading.” When teams take on new initiatives it’s not unusual for an engineer with a particular interest to permanently switch teams to work on that initiative.Unlike Spotify Squads, teams are not tied to Initiatives. We anticipate teams outliving initiatives, and being able to handle concurrent initiatives. This doesn’t preclude a team having a single initiative for it’s lifetime.Like Spotify, we strive to make a team operate and feel like a startup. Our teams have a strong identity and are empowered and independent. Teams are self organizing and self prioritizing. Teams select their own development methodology. Agile methodologies are strongly encouraged and most teams have backlogs, stand-ups, sprints and retrospectives. Some adopt more rigorous Agile methodologies.Strong team code stewardship is encouraged. We use stewardship to describe an ownership model where one team owns repositories of code and takes responsibility to encourage, review and approve modifications made by other teams. Gerrit is used to facilitate the review process.Unlike Spotify, teams have no product owners or business owners. Some teams include business partners. Ownership is considered an anti-pattern since it implies disempowerment of the team members who are not owners. KPIs and collaboration are king. Also unlike Spotify, we don’t appoint different individuals to the doing and prioritizing of work, believing these concepts are fundamentally indivisible. Prioritization happens by the team vigorously debating hypotheses and coming to agreement on the next hypotheses to test, factoring in both impact and feasibility.Teams release early and often. “Minimum Viable Product” is a Gilt mantra.Teams are encouraged to be highly analytical. We a/b test almost everything and discourage making decisions based on gut instinct. However, we respect intuition and encourage broad hypothesizing to ensure we optimize towards global rather than local maximas.IngredientsTeams are organizationally flat and cross-functional. To increase the likelihood they’ll execute successfully on their initiatives we use a palette of team ingredients as a guide to ensuring the team is appropriately staffed.For a team to be successful at Gilt they need some combination of the ingredients: product visionary, coder, presenter, visual designer, business thinker, organizer, motivator, quality manager, coach, analyst, architect, writer, visual designer and ux specialist.Rather than filling a narrow role, team members add a set of ingredients. This expectation both pushes and nurtures each team member. We don’t consider “It’s not my job to &hellip;” an acceptable way to start a sentence.Depending on each team’s initiative, a different blend of these ingredients is optimal. One person might provide several ingredients, for example, a member who conducts tests, writes feature code and collects and analyses data.Teams lacking key ingredients are assisted either by adding additional members or by external coaching.OversightA bi-weekly check-in gives each team a regular opportunity to provide an update on their results and seek guidance on their current direction. In addition to the team, attendees to this meeting alternate between a panel of technical managers and a panel of senior executives from across the company.All check-in meetings have the same agenda. (1) a presentation of KPIs and their history (2) a presentation of recent a/b tests or other recent data and the associated learnings and insights (3) the story: a quick overview of tactics for the next few weeks. The prescriptiveness of this agenda is to encourage teams to go deep on the strategy and the data supporting it and avoid discussing feature and UX nuances. Unchecked, these discussions historically tended towards feature debate at the expense of discussing results.Enabling AutonomyTo allow teams to operate as autonomously we encourage the decentralization of almost everything.Decentralization minimizes the dependencies teams have on other teams or systems, allowing them to develop code and release it to production with minimal external interaction.Recently we’ve made a large investment in the tools and automation to enable this decentralization. We’re well on our way to fully automated system provisioning and configuration. We’ve made a similar investment in our application architecture, moving away from monoliths and towards lots of small independent applications and lots of small independent services. This in combination with our continuous delivery pipeline allows teams to take complete control over delivering software to production. Although we’ve made a big investment here, it’s a work in progress.Extra-team CommunicationIn addition to the bi-weekly check-in meetings, we encourage the use of several other mechanisms for cross team communication and collaboration.Tech Bytes: Monthly, each team sends out an email to a broad distribution, outlining the recent achievements of the team, framed by their KPIs.Lightning Presentations: Teams self-organize to run a meeting with quick-fire presentations on notable pieces of technology or features that have been developed or deployed recently. Everyone is welcome at the meeting and pizza and beer serve as bait to attract a wide audience.Hack sessions: techies are encouraged to periodically take a break from their initiatives and join forces with other teams to work on things they care deeply about. Projects run the gamut from architectural changes, tools, bug squashes, a/b test infrastructure to user facing features.Stakeholder Communication: Teams self organize to communicate regularly with and get input from their various stakeholders.Guilds: Gilt has a fairly loose implementation of the Guild concept, defined by Spotify as an “organic and wide-reaching ‘community of interest’, a group of people who want to share knowledge, tools, code, and practices.” We have fairly active groups that self organize around areas including front end engineering and architecture.Does this Process Work, and Will It Work for You?Over the years we’ve used several different approaches for managing and organizing the Gilt development team. The one described above has been in active use for about 15 months.The current approach embraces technology as a key differentiator for Gilt and serves to establish our technology department as a leadership organization rather than a service organization.Being a leadership organization sounds great, but it’s not a panacea. It creates additional demands on teams, and requires them to have a deep understanding of our business and a strong point of view, clear vision and driving ambition. We need entrepreneurs to make this model succeed.Not all technologists want to take this on. If you do, this approach might work for you.",

We&rsquo;ve found that Linux containers best meets our needs since it&rsquo;s readily available and has near bare metal performance when running multiple containers. We&rsquo;re likely to end up with thousands of VMs, so we also looked at private cloud solutions that could manage these VMs with a UI interface as well as an API. Cloudstack really stood out for us during our evaluations, however it doesn&rsquo;t yet support LXC&ndash;so we&rsquo;ve decided to move forward with the best fit and add LXC support to Cloudstack.Latest information and progress can be found on the LXC Support in Cloudstack page.",

        "excerpt": "When Sandy hit New York, many of us were directly impacted in some way. After the first week, power had been restored in our main office and in most of our homes. Our focus started to shift from covering basic needs to finding a way to help the New York region rebuild. Eventually we decided to build gilt.com/give - with a focus on driving donations to the affected region and foot traffic to businesses that really need help. The idea behind ‘give’ is simple: make a donation and get a voucher for up to 50% off at any participating business.The initial brainstormings started on Saturday afternoon following the hurricane, and by Sunday night we had a strong group of Gilt employees across the company that wanted to be part of gilt.com/give. It was quite a big effort— we had to build the applications, find partners, vet local businesses, and spread the word. Last week, in 6 days, we built something we’re actually quite proud of; it was a week-long, company-wide hackathon— with most nights ending after 3 in the morning.We wanted to share a bit of what we actually built: the tech stack behind gilt.com/give. One of the main architectural initiatives at Gilt is something we call LOSA - Lots of Small Applications. Generally, we prefer having many single purpose applications to a few monolithic application and believe this micro services approach has the right set of tradeoffs to help us scale the Gilt Tech org. One nice benefit of LOSA is that it was pretty clear how we would build gilt.com/give— just a set of new small applications!Choosing a good name is tough and this was no exception. We had a pretty lively debate on what to call this app: is it a program? A charity? A benefit? Would we ever reuse any of the software we were about to build? Ultimately we settled on ‘effort’ as the internal name for the software applications - an effort can be a ‘relief effort’ which mapped nicely to what we were doing, but was general enough that we might be able to apply this to different problems.So what did we build?web-effort: a Scala/play web application rendering the templates, css, and javascript, built on top of Gilt services and our internal UI build tools for managing and deploying assetssvc-effort: a server providing a restful interface to key resourcesan order processing library (turning a donation into a Gilt order so it can actually be processed)PostgreSQL database: a new database instance and schemaInternally, when you donate, we map the charity you selected to an offer on Gilt City - which is how we can accurately track every dollar and generate a nice voucher for each donation.Building the app was amazing. Most pieces were inside a single SBT multimodule build; once you’ve written code with SBT and ~compile there is honestly no going back. All Scala— and for some folks on the team this was their first time learning Scala.We use gerrit for code review, and one of the best features of a week long hackathon was really the process of development and code review. Basically, we all worked individually or in small teams on the different applications and features of effort. Each change was pushed to Gerrit. Every couple hours, we would pause then, as a group, review each individual change. This was maybe the best way for all of us to share with each other how the system worked. I personally learned an incredible amount about Scala, functional programming, and HTML5. By the end, I had even contributed a small CSS change with the help of the team!Once deployed to production, we ran a quick load test and were pleasantly surprised - this stack is fast and scales nicely.Simple load test of play serving a simple page (single node w/ no external service calls) - almost 10k RPS on a single node!ab -k -n 10000 -c 50 'http://web1:9510/give/faq' # external url: http://www.gilt.com/give/faq",

The two real-world scenarios that got implemented in the lab exercises was to rewrite a piece of Java in Scala and to integrate Scala with existing Java source code.

        "excerpt": "Over the past several months several high traffic services have gone live at Gilt using MongoDB as a back end. MongoDB collections are a really good fit for many of our use cases. What we&rsquo;ve found is that when MongoDB is happy it runs fast and reliably; but there are a few things that can catch you out.Throttle your writes/updatesMongoDB uses a global write lock. Only one process can write at a time, and while writing is happening, nothing can read (items will queue). A very high write load will make read operations very slow.If you need to do data migrations or batch jobs of any kind on your DB, you will need to ensure that the writes happen at a rate of &lt; 50 per second if not using SSD (you can go higher with SSDs). Usually, you&rsquo;ll need to implement some way of prioritizing real-time updates during this process.If you expect a high write load during normal operation, you need to think about sharding. Good capacity planning and loadtesting prior to going live are important.SSDsMongoDB write performance is limited by disk performance, so if lots of writes are going to happen SSDs are a must.Load testingWhile performance testing your service, make sure to use a write load as well as a read-only load, to simulate how your service will perform in production. Manage the length of field namesMongo stores the field name as part of each record. If you pick very long names for your fields your data will be larger than it needs to be. MongoDB only performs well if it can keep working data in memory, so keep field names as short as is reasonable.Use indexesFor any substantial dataset, query performance will suck if you don’t use the right indexes (I have seen it make a difference of about 4 orders of magnitude in response time). More info here: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/IndexesIndexed data doesn’t have to be unique, and compound indexes are supported.Use the _id field wiselyMongoDB requires this field and always creates an index on it, so if possible actually use it for something useful.Think about how your records will grow over timeIf your record grows in size, MongoDB will have to move it. This is the most expensive thing you can do in MongoDB, because it means two writes, and then all indexes need to be updated as well (more writes). If your records are likely to grow it’s worth creating them with currently unused attributes in the documents (set to whitespace or similar). This means your updates won’t always lead to document moves. This needs to be balanced against unnecessary bloat in your document size, though. Don’t use ensureIndex in codeBuilding an index is a blocking operation for MongoDB, and it won’t service requests while the index build is in progress. If you add a new index via code, the index will get created when you deploy your service, which is probably not what you want (essentially, you’ll end up bringing your own service down for however long it takes to build the index).For production instances, the instance needs to be temporarily removed from the replica set, the index rebuilt, and then the instance is re-added. This process gets followed for all members of a replica set.Don’t keep unnecessary indexes aroundIndexes incur a cost when records are moved.",

Hack with people that you don&rsquo;t usually work with.3. Hack with people that you don&rsquo;t usually work with.4. Focus on building internal tools and cleaning up code.The EventDay One started with Yoni Goldberg keynoting event with a brief introduction and time allowance for pitching project ideas. A week prior to the event, engineers contributed a multitude of ideas for projects&ndash;some tongue-in-cheek grand aspirations while others were practical for the time allotment and would be of significant benefit to have. Anyone who hadn’t already committed to any projects quickly found teammates in groups up to five members, and everyone was off to the races.  The food was awesome; we kicked the day with pretzel-croissants from City Bakery (if you haven’t had one before, they are a must-try!) and a couple hours into our coding fest, we took a break to enjoy neatly-arranged rows of delicious steamed buns from the Baoery for lunch.   Some of us continued work after we dispersed on the first day, and since it wasn’t clear that we hadn’t planned on hosting an overnight stay, our intern, Lori, was left alone in the late evening wondering where everyone had gone.   Almost everyone was able to return for the second day to hole-up for the final stretch. A couple groups scrambled to put the finishing touches on their projects to ensure they were presentable (complete with ASCII art) in the minutes leading up to our presentation party while other groups started early on the celebratory beer and pizza.  The ProjectsSome of the projects that were born and presented at this hackathon included:    •    A radial dependency graph of all of Gilt’s services    •    Implementation of a predictive algorithm to estimate the resources required for a customer service project    •    A UI A/B testing framework to share and manage the way too many active Gilt’s A/B tests    •    Significant improvements to an internal UI mockup tool for non-specialists    •    Various improvements to our version control workflow and application deployment processRetrospectiveThe participants were really enthusiastic about having a block of uninterrupted coding time, having the freedom to explore languages/frameworks that they&rsquo;re interested in, and having the opportunity to work in ad hoc teams.Although Gilt occasionally hosts and participates in hackathons such as our recent public API hackathon, we’re really hoping this one focuses solely on internal tools will become a regular part of Gilt’s tech culture. -Yoni Goldberg and Chris Cho",

Websockets are the perfect candidate.Live is written in Scala on the Play 2.0.1 framework and uses Akka for thread management, a decision based on the the framework&rsquo;s scalability and websocket integration approach.What is Supported?Websockets are only supported in Firefox 11+, Chrome 6.0+, Safari 5.0.1+ and Internet Explorer 10.0. This does exclude a set of users from the experience, and it is a drawback, but we feel the benefits outweigh the loss.The ClientThe client uses the jQuery Isotope library to render the product messages in a multi-size, dynamic layout. In order to prevent an excessive number of products in the browser and save CPU resources on the client’s machine, the client removes the top unseen products from the DOM, a process we call “Chunking” – after our favorite character from Goonies.Load BalancingLive uses the Zeus load balancer. Initial load testing allowed for only 500 concurrent connections, but after a few configuration tweaks, we have reached over 28K concurrent connections and counting!Inventory UpdatesOne of the coolest features of live is our inventory updates, made possible through the use of websockets. If there are 5 or fewer items left to buy, you’ll see a countdown flag on the product, and if you stay around, you’ll see the count drop from 5 units, to 4…to Sold out!SummaryWe’ve learned new technologies, faced scalability challenges, and most importantly had fun through the development of Live. We are already forming ideas to take live to the next level and use websockets in other areas of the site.Thanks for reading, and let us know if you have any suggestions!",

        "excerpt": "You might be surprised to learn that Gilt Tech has a Program Management Organization (aka &ldquo;The PMO&rdquo;).Why do I think you might be surprised?  Well, the role of project management in traditional organizations has typically been one associated with paperwork and process (We need to talk about your TPS reports&hellip;).  It has also been associated with hindering rapid development and slowing things down.  These negative connotations are behind the reasons why many people struggle with the idea of having a PMO or a project manager on a team.We strive to change this.  We believe every organization and team should invest in project management if you want to work smarter and spend more time on what really matters.  Here’s some reasons why&hellip;One of the many tenets we are taught in our training is the “Triangle of Truth”.  The project manager’s key function is historically described as making sure a project meets its objectives, is on time and on budget.What happens more often than not is that a project manager is so focused on driving to deadline, they lose sight of the big picture.  I have often heard project managers and others describe their job as “my responsibility is to make sure we hit our schedule no matter what” &ndash; and this is dangerous thinking.  Our function is so much bigger than maintaining a list of tickets on schedule.The project manager’s responsibility is to make sure we are doing the right work at the right time and with the right people.  Let’s break this down a bit.Right WorkA good project manager doesn’t simply take orders and execute on them.  We have the authority to ensure we are working on what will bring the biggest contribution to the organization, and constantly question and re-evaluate this based on a combination of hard data, an understanding of the business we are working in, and good intuition.Is this the most important thing we could be doing right now?  If it isn’t, how can we bring the right people together to negotiate and agree to the right work?How will this work both positively and negatively impact others?Is the work defined enough that we feel confident in its execution?  What is the Minimum Viable Product?  Is the work actionable?What does the data tell us and what decisions need to be made based on this data?Right TimeA good project manager needs to have an understanding of both internal and external factors behind the schedule, and make decisions based on a deeper understanding of what is driving the timeline, maximize efficiency, and take the initiative to make adjustments along the way.What are the market conditions like?  What are our competitors doing? Is it the right time to be launching this kind of product?Are we managing time appropriately?  Is the team focused and if not, what can we do to eliminate the noise?Are we working in the most efficient way?  What changes to our current process need to be made to maximize our efficiency?Are there deadlines that are fixed due to events such as press releases, end of quarter, or financial reporting needs?Right PeopleA good project manager is also a people manager.  Yes, I’m adjusting the “Cost” part of the triangle to represent people &ndash; because people’s time = money.  A good project manager knows that a primary function is to alleviate any roadblocks that get in the way of your team focusing on the most important work, even if this means picking up the slack yourself.  We are also responsible for team building, encouraging growth and learning, and are often the public face or “go-to person” on the team.Do you have the right people on the team to accomplish your mission?  If not, what can you do to get the people you need?Are the right communication methods in place so that all of the people involved in the project have a clear understanding of what is happening?  Do all of the people outside of the project have access to information?Do all these people really need to be at this meeting?  What can we do to eliminate unnecessary meetings for people so they can focus?Is the team happy, engaged, and enjoying their work?  What can we do or change to maximize happiness and productivity?As you can see, there’s a lot more to project management than managing the schedule, taking notes and executing orders.  Project managers oversee the end-to-end execution of a project, making sure we are doing the right work at the right time and with the right people.  We are experts in efficiency, negotiation, communication, strategy and big picture thinking with the ability to break the big things down into actionable chunks.  We not only get things done &ndash; we get the right things done in the best way possible.",

        "category": "leadership",
        "tags": "PMO culture leadership",
        "excerpt": "I have a son who is obsessed with Pixar movies, so I have seen &ldquo;Ratatouille&rdquo; about 100 times. It wasn&rsquo;t until recently however, that I started to draw parallels between the movie&rsquo;s lessons and lessons in organizational culture.Lesson One: &ldquo;Anyone Can Cook&rdquo;The core vision statement of Gusteau, the original chef who built his restaurant into an empire and what inspired a rat to pursue his dream to become a cook. There is debate around this vision within the movie &ndash; just because anyone can cook it doesn&rsquo;t mean they should. Some people are better at this than others, and not every creation is going to make the menu. The point is that the vision is simple, aspirational, and inspiring.Lesson Two: A gift is not enough &ndash; you need a passion. And mentors.Remy the rat has a gift for being able to smell whatever ingredients are in something. He could have easily resigned to the comfortable position of poison checker for his rat clan. But he was soon bored &ndash; he wanted to create something. To add to this world instead of taking from it. You have people in our organization with gifts.  You have people with passion. You need to mentor these people (as imaginary Gusteau and Colette did for Remy) so they are able to express their passion creatively.Lesson Three: Complacency = &ldquo;Follow the Recipe&rdquo;With Gusteau dead, the new leaders at the restaurant have instructed the team to simply &ldquo;follow the recipe&rdquo;. Gusteau was paid to create &ndash; they are paid to follow what Gusteau already did and not improvise. Seems pretty logical &ndash; just keep doing what you know works and you continue on the same trajectory. Except the customers are getting bored. They want to know what does the chef have that is new. Organizations are in danger of falling into &ldquo;follow the recipe&rdquo; complacency where talented people are not willing to rock the boat due to fear of something or because they feel defeated, or simply restricted from making their own improvisations.Lesson Four:  Frozen Foods might make you a lot of money, but at what cost to morale?The new chef in charge is highly focused on making more money in the fastest, easiest way possible. In the movie, it is by expanding Gusteau&rsquo;s recipes into a pre-packaged, frozen-foods line. Will it bring in revenue? Yes. Is anyone inspired?  No. The team feels like what they are doing is sacrificing the quality of their work, and killing the passion in their hearts that drives them to create every day.  In fact, there is a point in the movie where this plan is disbanded and the team rallies around a bonfire of the frozen foods and marketing materials and toasts to a new era of getting back to making real food for real people.Lesson Five: &ldquo;You are the boss. Inspire them.&rdquo;In the movie the team is about to face their toughest food critic who can make or break their restaurant. Linguini asks Colette &ldquo;What should I do?&rdquo;. She replies, &ldquo;You are the boss. Inspire them.&rdquo; I’m sure you all have teams of people who report to you, who look to you for guidance, mentorship, and they take their cues from what you do and what you say. It is your responsibility to inspire them, to ignite the passion that made them want to work there to begin with. If you don&rsquo;t believe it &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t feel it yourself you can&rsquo;t expect them to believe and feel it too.Lesson Six:  Give the customers something new by iterating on what already is.The best dishes were iterations on existing recipes, not completely new ideas. How can you improve and innovate in simple ways to get some quick wins with measurable impact?  What can you do in the short term that is actionable and achievable but still innovative?Lesson Seven:  Take off the toke and give your tiny chef the credit.Remy grows continuously frustrated because he never receives recognition or credit for his work. (He spends most of the movie hiding under the toke of Linguini, telling him what to do.) Every company needs to do more in this area. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes that many people don&rsquo;t see (and then they start to question the value of it). Bring more of this to the forefront. Thank people more, publicly recognize them, call them out for even the small things. Foster a culture of &ldquo;I have your back.&rdquo;. Remy is a rat &ndash; you can imagine what happened when people found out he was the cook behind all the innovation in the kitchen. Recognize people for taking initiative and have their back regardless if the outcome is good or bad.Lesson Eight:  Connect with people on an emotional level.This goes for both your employees and the customers you have. At the end of the movie there is this wonderful scene when the big bad critic guy tastes the dish of ratatouille prepared for him and he flashes back to an emotional moment where he is a boy being comforted by his mother after having gotten hurt falling off his bike. The food connected with him emotionally. Your products can do this too. You can do this with your staff. Listen, empathize, connect, guide, inspire.If anything, I hope you go watch the movie. :-)",

        "excerpt": "Arguably, the job of an engineering manager is to hire and sculpt a development team that is not only highly productive, but also precisely resourced for immediate business priorities.Easier said than done. Businesses are highly erratic organisms. Especially start-ups. From week to week our business environment changes and company priorities evolve accordingly. In response to this, so does the position of senior management on the best way to adapt.Senior managers flourish in these rough seas, happily charting new courses as new storms brew.Development teams don’t fare as well when deprived of continuity. Reorganizing teams and re-prioritizing efforts at the first sign of trouble is problematic for a few reasons:Engineers can’t be thought of as fungible resources that can easily skip between teams. Optimal team dynamics form slowly. Interactions take a while to mature and processes need time to be adapted to the specific needs of the team.Great products don’t happen overnight either. They typically result from several iterations by stable teams. The first incarnation of any effort is almost always sub-par. This is as it should be.  As Reid Hoffman said: “If you&rsquo;re not embarrassed by your first product release, you&rsquo;ve released too late”. The real magic happens after the first or second iteration when the team really starts understanding what the problem is and has acquired the domain knowledge and built the tools to attack it.So how should you get the most of out your team in an unstable environment?Balance the team: When the ratio between engineering team size to the rest of the company is too small, you create the capacity to generate many more ideas than can possibly be implemented, or even discussed fully. This results in endless distractions and prioritization sessions, and reduces critical focus on the work currently being done.There are a few models for creating balance. One is to simply drive everything from the tech team, for example GitHub has zero managers and developers are 100% responsible for the product direction. This isn’t an option for most companies, but creating a engineering team that is appropriately resourced for the overall organization is.Maintain Focus: Create a North Star for engineering teams by creating, communicating and repeating a strategy for your company and product. Define KPIs to track progress against the strategy. Stay focused on these KPIs for at least a quarter before iterating the strategy.Limit Distractions: A colleague recently reminded me of a great quote from The Mythical Man Month: “the best engineering manager I ever saw served often as a giant flywheel, his inertia damping the fluctuations that came from the market and management people”.Be the flywheel and keep your team focused on your strategy. Limit non-essential or off-track meetings and help cross functional teams focus and work tightly on active initiatives. Project rooms allowing face-to-face communication and tight teamwork can be extremely effective.Empower and Encourage Ownership: Encourage teams to take complete, long-term ownership of initiatives and the artifacts (code) that they produce. Adopt tools that help reinforce ownership while maintaining flexibility (we use Gerrit at Gilt). Defend the team from the inevitable onslaught of requests to “re-prioritize” their current work that reduce ownership and focus.Doing this isn’t easy, but as a managers our responsibility, perhaps our biggest responsibility is to make sure we have a strategy, to repeat it until people are tired hearing it and to do everything we can to maintain appropriate inertia around it.Quinn.Follow Gilt&rsquo;s awesome tech team on twitter @gilttech and read about our new API at http://dev.gilt.com",

        "excerpt": "In a humanitarian effort to improve developer quality of life, we at Gilt recently stopped supporting Internet Explorer 6. This means we no longer use, develop or test for the browser. Given the small and shrinking population of IE6 users and the auto-upgrades planned for this year, we felt that it is worth our developers&rsquo; happiness (and sanity) to abandon support efforts. Our FEET (Front End Engineering Team) are certainly happy to let go of &rsquo;[if IE 6]&rsquo; conditional comment hackery and other ugly shoehorning techniques.We found ourselves wondering&hellip; Would IE6 users have a better shopping experience if we redirected them to the minimalistic mobile version of gilt.com? Could the simple no frills layout designed for mobile devices just might be an improvement over the fully-featured yet unsupported site for IE6 users? Let&rsquo;s walk through the exercise of answering this question, from data collection to results summarization.Split TestingMost often the best way to answer a question is with an experiment. In the context of Gilt and e-commerce, we find split testing to be an effective method for assessing the effect of changes (treatments) to the user shopping experience, be it the reorganization of a sale page or a modification to our checkout flow. Controlled split tests allow us to gauge the impact on our KPIs with statistical confidence, relying less on opinion and more on evidence-based reasoning.The idea is to separate a representative subset of the user-base to expose the change to and assess the effects of the change on this smaller group before making the decision to roll out to all visitors. This &lsquo;test&rsquo; subset should be paired with a mutually exclusive 'control&rsquo; subset. Both subsets should be randomly sampled such that they are characteristically the same as each other. We may or may not choose to limit the testing to a segment of our users. For instance, we may want to limit the test to NY members, in which case our 'test&rsquo; and 'control&rsquo; groups should only be chosen from members in the NY population. Comparing Conversion RatesIf the redirect has any notable effect on the user experience, it should show in the proportion of buyers-to-visitors, a.k.a. 'visitor conversion rate&rsquo;. Conversion rates are proportions and from a statistical point of view are quite easy to work with. We will be comparing the conversion rate of a 'Test&rsquo; group that sees the mobile site to a 'Control&rsquo; group that sees the regular site. For sake of brevity, I will not go into detail about the nuances of measuring our numerous other site metrics (revenue, dwell time, drop-off&hellip; etc.) and test scenarios (multi-variate, overlapping, longitudinal&hellip; etc.).On a high-level, we want to accomplish the following steps:Segment out our IE6 visitors - our 'IE6 base&rsquo;.Randomly sample a representative test group from the IE6 base and redirect them to m.gilt.com.Measure the difference in 'visitor conversion&rsquo; between the test group and the remainder of the IE6 base (control).Test or control group membership is tracked via a randomly assigned 'partition&rsquo; number (integer) that is issued on first visit in a cookie and persisted thereafter in our operational database. We can then redirect IE6 users to m.gilt.com based on the partition they have and whether the user-agent string indicates they are running IE6. The mobile version of our site is very lean and lacks javascript tagging for tracking site interactions. As a result, we will need to fall back to some good old ad-hoc data munging from our server logs and match up against our OLTP database to piece together the conversion rates per group.We can segment out IE6 visits quite easily by checking the GET request user-agent string in our server logs.

We can use it find unique IE6 visitors by day (our IE6 base group) with the following query:Splunk query 1 (output filename: all_ie6_users.csv):host=\"olb*\" guid \"compatible; MSIE 6.0\" | stats count by guid, date_mday, date_monthHalf of these users belong to our test group and were randomly sectioned out and redirected to mobile.

        "excerpt": "I arrived at 2 Park Ave on the first day of my internship not quite sure what I was getting myself into.  I had just finished my sophomore year at Dartmouth and was looking forward to my first time living in New York City.  My sophomore year was packed with computer science.  I had taken the notorious software design and algorithm design courses, I was doing research with the chair of the Dartmouth computer science department, and now, I thought as I exited the elevator on the fourth floor, surely I was ready for the industry.My first experience working with the Distribution team was a two day long architecture plan-a-thon for the new messaging system at Gilt, a system that facilitates seamless communication and synchronization between Gilt admin, distribution centers, and shipping companies.  As the second day drew to a close, my boss, Chris Hazlett, began to explain my role in this slick new messaging system that we were designing.  The start of that conversation went something like this:Chris:              &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like you to put together a web app with the spring mvc In scala that makes ajax requests to a web server serving search results from a lucene search engine which you&rsquo;ll build and format the response with css and javascript,&rdquo;Me:                  &ldquo;Um, yeah&hellip; What&rsquo;s a web server?”Everyone:       “Oh boy.”I had a lot to learn.  We spent the next half hour going over a lot of the concepts I was missing.  “web servers”, “model-view-controller”, “ajax”, and more.  Often these words would rest on a whole stack of other important concepts that I also did not yet understand.             “What’s ajax?” “Oh, well its just the process of making asynchronous requests to a separate web server to dynamically fill in content on a webpage.  Don’t worry, you’ll just use jquery for that.”“What’s jquery?” “…a javascript library.” “ What’s javascript?” “…”And so on.My first few weeks at Gilt, I was very frustrated.  How could my computer science program have left me unprepared for industry?  Granted, my background is focused more on theory than systems.  I do research in algorithm design and until I began to learn languages outside of my classes, my strongest languages were Haskell and C.  But still, regardless of my theoretical focus, I was a computer science student, damn it.  What was I missing? It gradually dawned on me that most of my frustrations could be reduced to two missing links in my CS education: object-orientation and the web.  These are two topics that are not strongly emphasized in traditional computer science programs.  I resented the fact that there were no web development topics covered in any classes at Dartmouth, and that instead I had been exposed to what now seemed to be esoteric, dated concepts. The hours spent in gdb sifting through hundreds of lines of C to fix elusive seg faults and memory leaks now seemed futile now.  The mind bending recursion, pointers, the linked lists, the hash tables, the mallocs, reallocs, the frees, ALL FOR WHAT!  After briefly wallowing in my sorrow, my boss reminded me that the whole reason I was here was to learn.  So I started to learn.I spent my first weeks at Gilt learning new tools.  My browser was constantly filled with tabs on scala, git, lucene, css, and jquery.  The complexity of the problem assigned to me also became clearer.  I was being asked to build the full stack of a web app.  This meant writing everything from the css and javascript for the frontend, to the complex indexing and searching backend that would process and search new messages in real-time as they flowed through our messaging system.  Okay, fine. In reality, once I overcame that initial shock and the task of setting up my development environment (surely a twisted form of tech hazing), the general learning process was much more painless than I had anticipated.  Most of the tools I was using were well documented, and when in doubt I had the most thorough and accessible form of documentation around: people!  I consulted frequently with folks in all different groups, front end, algorithms, distribution, etc.  As I learned the tools, my team was making fantastic headway on the new messaging system.  We moved into a small conference room to make collaboration and communication easier.  Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins became the natural theme of our industrious lair as we moved steadily towards the completion of our first iteration on the project. Around this time, about halfway through my internship, the focus of my work in the office shifted from learning to building.  As I finally understood how tools like Lucene, Jquery, and Scala worked and how all the pieces of a full web-app stack fit together, I began to feel more at ease and developed much more efficiently.  I quickly made headway on the new user interface and the actor-based search engine library. I also started to meet others outside of the tech team.  Settlers of Catan frequently occupied my Thursdays, volleyball occupied my Mondays, and occasionally there would be, ahem, modest company gatherings held in abandoned four-story tall synagogues.  The Friday of my second to last week with the company, I was able to present my final project to the rest of the tech team during the 5@4, which seemed well received.  All in all, it was clear that my work was going to have a lasting impact, and would make the distribution team’s job faster and easier.            As my internship draws to a close, its now quite clear to me that the frustration I initially felt towards my computer science background was naïve.  A Computer Science degree is not supposed to be a vocational degree.  Computer Science is truly a science, and the point of studying it is to gain exposure to and mastery of the foundations.  Once you know how to think like a computer scientist, learning new tools in the field comes quite naturally.  That’s the idea, and thankfully, it works.  ",

        "excerpt": "Managing the back button on the web is hard, especially remembering the previous page&rsquo;s state when the back button is used. Fragment identifiers can be a solution, and there are some great plugins out there which use that method. However, there&rsquo;s only one URL fragment, so identifiers need to be carefully namespaced to avoid collisions and the fragment in the URL becomes detritus that affects bookmarking, along with looking unpleasant and confusing to the user.On Gilt&rsquo;s new site, Park &amp; Bond, I wanted to stay away from fragment identifiers (/products/denim#color=blue), in keeping with Gilt&rsquo;s commitment to forward-thinking front end engineering practices. We believe in progressive enhancement at Gilt, and I was able to make use of HTML5 sessionStorage to provide a better experience for our customers.Though there is no way to know for absolutely certain, one way to know if a user has hit the back button is to configure caching correctly on the server, and then determine whether the browser is using cached HTML or a new page request. The HTTP 1.1 specification, section 13.13, states that a &ldquo;history mechanism is meant to show exactly what the user saw at the time when the resource was retrieved.&rdquo; Chrome and IE, and usually Firefox, behave basically the same in using cached HTML where it makes sense, and re-executing JavaScript. Firefox sometimes shows the last state of the page without executing script, so in that case it&rsquo;s not necessary to do anything.If a unique page token is added to the HTML of each page view, it is possible both to store information unique to that token and to use its value to determine whether the page has been viewed before. I use a data attribute on the HTML element to store this server-generated token.I built a small JavaScript object called Gilt.pageToken to provide an API for storing values on a page token key using sessionStorage. Using the session, there&rsquo;s little risk of overloading the browser&rsquo;s storage limits and no way we will restore things we don&rsquo;t want to restore if the user comes back the next day in a different browser tab. The API is simple:Gilt.pageToken.get('key');Gilt.pageToken.set('key', value);The value can be anything; it is transformed into a sessionStorage string with JSON.stringify().So, how is this useful?The product listing page on Park &amp; Bond allows continual scrolling, making additional ajax requests as the user goes down the page. If a user clicks on a product, goes to its detail page, and then goes back to the listing page, the user expects the page to restore its previous state, including any active facets and the scrolled-to additional products. However, the browser&rsquo;s HTML cache will not have this information, since the page load included only the first set of products and facets.So, when the user clicks a product, Gilt.pageToken is used to store the scroll position (as a vertical offset integer) and the query object that holds the facets which were active at the time of the click. When the user hits back, Gilt.pageToken looks up those values by the current page token key. If that key exists in sessionStorage and has values, those values are used to restore the page state.The session storage pageToken object after a few page views might look something like this:{  \"PT131741761614767\":  {    \"rotatorStatus\":\"3\"  },",

        "excerpt": "by Amy DeCicco, Taxonomist and Steve O’Brien, Sr. Software EngineerHalston, We Have a ProblemLike most rapidly growing start ups, product classification at Gilt Groupe was not fully formed at the outset. Initially, products were tagged with keywords, and those keywords were user-defined and free-form. One person’s “shoes” was another person’s “lace-ups” was another person’s “monkstraps,” and as a result it became increasingly more difficult to assess inventory by category of product. Additionally, as inventory grew and there was a need to surface product categories on gilt.com to help shoppers navigate through sales, this method of classifying and organizing products became rapidly untenable. In response to this problem, around a year ago Gilt introduced a more structured 2000-term “product hierarchy” for merchandising specialists to index their inventory, a component of which was to attach a “pretty name” or short label to each product category for front-end category navigation. This structured classification was a step in the right direction, and improved inventory reporting, but it wasn’t the best solution for creating intuitive user experiences for shoppers on gilt.com. Two thousand very specific categories were too granular for the number of products typically featured in a sale. In addition, categories were not hierarchical, mutually exclusive, unique, contextual, or even very illustrative. As a result, Gilt’s site filter tools were often imprecise, created user confusion, and fostered suboptimal user experiences.Redundancy &amp; lack of meaning in drop downsCategory filtering without context - &ldquo;coffee table, crewneck, download, earrings&rdquo;Gilt needed a way to negotiate between the very specific product categories used by the Merchandising and Planning teams to analyze their business and what the shopper saw in category navigation. We needed to build a taxonomy tool and the back-end database infrastructure to support it. Taxonomy (Not Taxidermy) Taxonomy is a method of organizing categories of content on a website. Taxonomies are built to help you navigate through content  in top and left nav experiences all over the web. Taxonomy is hierarchical, that is, taxonomies are made up of a root and multiple category levels which have parent-child and sibling relationships.An e-commerce taxonomyGilt’s taxonomy needed to support navigation through product categories and subcategories in men’s, women’s, and children’s apparel and accessories, as well as home goods and gifts sales, and support attributes for additional navigational filtering.Taxonomy ModelAt Gilt the taxonomy tool functions as the bridge between the merchandizing departments&rsquo; product categories and the web taxonomy you see on Gilt.com. The tool is also the management system for front-end category creation/management. Gilt’s taxonomy tool allows for multiple taxonomies (separate roots for Gilt.com, Gilt Taste, Park &amp; Bond, et al) as well as attributes. It supports taxonomy scheduling and publishing, importing, exporting, and copying. It supports 1:1, 1:many, and many:1 relationships between back-end product categories and the shopping categories users see on the site. For the Gilt site we mapped over 2000 back-end categories to 140 user-intuitive front-end categories.All products in Gilt&rsquo;s businesses belong to one of the above-mentioned internal product categories. These categories take into account separate business units and important distinctions between types of products as well as divvy up different kinds of products by type. These categories are mostly hidden from the customer when mapped to the user-friendly taxonomy shown on the site.The taxonomy management tool links front-end taxonomy with back-end product categories. Product categories can be mapped to more than one node in the taxonomy.  For example, our merchandisers classify some kid’s apparel as appropriate for both boys and girls as “unisex apparel.” In a filter tool, we want those unisex products to appear in both girls’ and boys’ filter selections. Taxonomies cannot be changed once published; A published taxonomy is cloned, and any changes go into a “draft” taxonomy until it is published and overrides the older one. Every taxonomy has a &ldquo;live&rdquo; date and time, so it can be made active at an exact  moment. Each previously published taxonomy is archived and serves as a historical audit trail.In addition to taxonomy functionality, we built the ability to associate attribute types and values to categories. Attributes describe a characteristic of a product. We can create attribute sets and their values in the taxonomy manager, and associate them to parts of a taxonomy or the entire taxonomy.Attribute sets applied to the root-level node of the Gilt Taste taxonomyWe use product attributes on the front end to provide users with visible options for clarifying and refining their browsing experience. This is referred to as &ldquo;faceting&rdquo; and can be used to apply criteria further drill down into a product listing.&ldquo;Trends&rdquo; is an attribute set that is applied to products to create collections on Gilt&rsquo;s Park and Bond site. Taxonomy in ActionThe taxonomy we build in the taxonomy management tool appears in filtering on sale pages on Gilt.com.Taxonomy creates context between categories through hierarchy.On the Park &amp; Bond site, the current live taxonomy is also visible: it drives the navigation bar that&rsquo;s present throughout the site, as well as category landing pages.Each heading and its subcategories in the top nav are pulled from the taxonomy management tool. ResultsWe began surfacing front-end categories to members gradually, and conducted A/B testing to measure whether add to cart and conversion improved. Today all members see the categories.  The categories areMulti-selectHierarchical &amp; contextualSimplifiedWe saw an improvement in cart add and conversion that coincided with the redesigned pages and introduction of taxonomy on the Gilt sites. We also heard positive feedback from our customer feedback system. In addition, the before and after screen grabs like the examples below tell a compelling story.  A gifts sale before taxonomy implementationA gifts sale after taxonomy implementation",

        "excerpt": "I walked into the office one morning to see my boss doing push-ups. Pictures were being taken and videos recorded. As a relatively new intern at the time, I was confused. It turned out he had answered a question with the word &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; breaking the only rule of the &ldquo;Game of Life&rdquo; at Gilt Tech. That type of thing isn&rsquo;t too unusual at Gilt – its culture encourages this sort of playful hazing team building exercise.Tech at Gilt is kind of its own community. How couldn&rsquo;t it be? Nerds love nerding out with other nerds (and our tech team is full of nerds). Github and twitter accounts are common here, and we use plenty of open source software. One of Gilt Tech&rsquo;s newer goals is to start contributing to the open source community, exemplified here in Mothership and in my own gem RubyXL.RubyXL is a gem which provides an API for programmatically modifying content and formatting of Excel&rsquo;s .xlsx and .xlsm formats, while preserving macros, drawings, and all content when parsing and writing. Currently, a couple of gems exist for xlsx files, but they are often missing core functionality (e.g. parsing, writing, the modification of styles, or the preservation of macros). RubyXL solves this, with an easy to understand structure and a simple set of calls to make all these modifications.One of the potentially more useful functions is the ability to extract a table from a worksheet and store it in a hash, given an array of headers/columns. If you know a table exists in an excel file which has columns &ldquo;Name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Age&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Height&rdquo;, the get_table function will search within the worksheet for a row with those 3 strings (they can be in any order, and the row could have more content, but those cells will be ignored), and will return a hash which is searchable both by row and column. The hash might look something like this:&gt; workbook.worksheets[0].get_table([\"Name\",\"Height\",\"Age\"])=&gt; {:Name=&gt;[\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Joe\"], :Height=&gt;[70, 65, 68], :Age=&gt;[30, 25, 35]:table=&gt;[     {:Name=&gt;\"John\", :Height=&gt;70, :Age=&gt;30},     {:Name=&gt;\"Jane\", :Height=&gt;65, :Age=&gt;25},      {:Name=&gt;\"Joe\", :Height=&gt;68, :Age=&gt;35}]}If you feel like using it or if you want more information, check it out on Github.

        "excerpt": "If you work at an e-commerce company, chances are you&rsquo;ve probably come across the term &ldquo;A/B testing&rdquo;. We all know that it has something to do with testing out new features on users and seeing which ones are &ldquo;better&rdquo;. A/B testing is really the practice of comparing the effect that a feature (&ldquo;treatment&rdquo; in statistical terms) has on different groups of users. For instance, you might be developing a new navigation bar for your Website. You can see if it improves how long users stay on your site by testing it on a group of users (A) and comparing them to users in another group (B) that are using the original navigation bar. Again in statistical lingo, group B would be considered your &ldquo;control group&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s important to note that you can test a variety of navigation bars here and not violate the principles behind A/B testing since your treatment is the type of bar you are exposing.Now you are probably wondering how dependency injection (DI) factors into A/B testing. DI is the design principle where your objects are assigned references to their dependencies at runtime. Generally speaking, objects using DI refer to their dependencies through interfaces or super classes so they are indifferent to how those dependencies are actually implemented and instantiated. There are a few frameworks in Java that leverage DI. For the work that we do at Gilt, we use Java Spring. The example in this post is in Spring but it&rsquo;s general enough that it can be applied to other frameworks.So now that we know what DI is, let&rsquo;s apply it to make A/B testing a part of your applications. In A/B testing, groups of users are exposed to a given treatment. That means we need to have a mapping between groups of users and the treatment that they are receiving. Java Spring makes that very easy; in your Spring configuration, you can create such a mapping using the map tag. For example: &lt;util:map id=\"ABTestMapping\"&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;    &lt;key&gt;      &lt;value&gt;group 1&lt;/value&gt;    &lt;/key&gt;    &lt;ref bean=\"baseline_nav\" /&gt;  &lt;/entry&gt;  &lt;entry&gt;    &lt;key&gt;      &lt;value&gt;group 2&lt;/value&gt;    &lt;/key&gt;    &lt;ref bean=\"test_nav1\" /&gt;  &lt;/entry&gt;   &lt;entry&gt;    &lt;key&gt;      &lt;value&gt;group 3&lt;/value&gt;    &lt;/key&gt;    &lt;ref bean=\"test_nav2\" /&gt;  &lt;/entry&gt;&lt;/util:map&gt; &lt;bean id=\"baseline_nav\" class=\"com.gilt.examples.BaselineNavBar\"/&gt;&lt;bean id=\"test_nav1\"    class=\"com.gilt.examples.NewNavBar1\"/&gt;&lt;bean id=\"test_nav2\"    class=\"com.gilt.examples.NewNavBar2\"/&gt; So in this map, our keys are different test groups of users and their corresponding values are the different navigation bar we will expose to them. This example is a bit contrived but it illustrates the point quite well. Instead of having to code A/B testing into your application, you can externalize it in a configuration. Java Spring instantiates this map and your application can use it to determine which navigation bar a user should see. A nifty trick in Spring is to use the import tag in your configuration. &lt;import resource=\"file:test_buckets.xml\"/&gt;This tag allows you to put your A/B testing configuration into a separate file which is very powerful. Doing so allows you to change which groups receive various treatments without having to recompile or redeploy your code. Simple. Fast. Very Useful.",

        "excerpt": "In  the summer of 2010, our Ops team was tasked with migrating our  production systems from one hosting platform to another and immediately  began to take stock of the challenges presented by our tools and  processes. At Gilt, we make extensive use of both Cobbler and Puppet for  our provisioning and configuration management, respectively. Configuration  management software like Puppet is awesome, but manually configuring  nodes and maintaining the relationships between nodes and classes can  quickly become overwhelming. System  provisioning software like Cobbler, while similarly awesome, doesn’t  really know what to do with servers once the OS is installed.Neither software package helps you track your hardware inventory, manage users, or monitor the health of your systems. So,  here we are, with a handful of software packages and a team of Systems  Engineers with one common goal: take a bunch of boxes filled with computer parts and turn them into fully-configured, usable, monitored  production servers. Being UNIX/Linux guys, we figured stitching  together stable single-purpose programs was preferable to reinventing  the wheel and cramming a bunch of disparate functionality into a single  software package. Enter Mothership.Mothership  is a modular, database-driven server provisioning and management system  written in python. We’ve currently got modules for interaction with and  management of: Puppet, Cobbler, LDAP, SSH, Zabbix, Zenoss, Citrix  Xenserver, Dell’s DRACs, user accounts, and DNS.Mothership  is also open source.

        "excerpt": "Product recommendations at Gilt work a little differently than they do at other companies.  For example, at Amazon they enjoy the benefit of having a relatively static and large inventory so they can do things like collaborative filter – where you can recommend a product based on what other people have bought or looked at. Gilt is unique because our inventory is in constant flux. The products we have one week are gone the next and there is a chance we won’t have them again. At Gilt, we’ve employed a technique called contextual retrieval. Contextual retrieval is a search method where we take elements from the user context to help them conduct a search. When someone sees a product that is sold out and they decide to waitlist it, we can infer a lot of things about the user. One is that they really want that product. Another is that we know everything about the product they are interested in. In fact, we use that product as a search query to find related ones that we have in our inventory whether they are currently on sale or not.So the steps involved in setting up a contextual retrieval based recommendation service are as follows:·      First, you are going to have to create a search index of your products.  Apache Lucene is a great piece of open source technology for doing just that. You are going to want to create an index that contains all the fields that you have describing your products. Those fields are basically the metadata that you need to find similar ones.·      The second step is search query manufacturing. This is where the recommendation magic really happens. When you construct your search from a product, not all fields are going to be equally important. In fact, it is very likely that different genres of products will have different fields that are going to be more valuable than others. To that end, you need to devise a weighting scheme where you boost the value of some fields over others.·      The third step is caching those recommendations.  You can quite easily get away with caching all your recommendations because unlike a search engine, you already know all the search queries that you are going to encounter – they are the products you have for sale. At Gilt, since we have new products every day, we generate and cache our recommendations once a day.·      The fourth (and most rewarding) step is using those recommendations in ways to help your users.  One of our customer pain points is that the product at Gilt sells out quickly.  When a user has decided that they want an item so much that they are willing to sign up for it on a waitlist, we want to do everything in our power to try to find them another product that they will be happy with.That’s pretty much what we aim to achieve at Gilt – Simple, Fast and Fun!",

        "category": "",
        "tags": "Objective-C mobile development gilt mobile",
        "excerpt": "As developers, we often find ourselves dealing with some variant of this scenario: we&rsquo;re iterating through a collection containing mixed object types, and we&rsquo;re only interested in objects of a certain type.For example, let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;ve got an NSArray representing desks in a classroom. Each array element corresponds to a specific physical desk, which may or may not be assigned to a student at any given time. If a desk is assigned to a student, the array element will contain an NSString instance whose value is the name of the student assigned to that desk. If a desk is unoccupied, the array will contain a pointer to NSNull instead.In Objective-C, the code for performing such a task usually looks something like://// assume the variable 'desks' points to a pre-existing NSArray//Class stringClass = [NSString class];NSUInteger deskCount = desks.count;for (NSUInteger i=0; i&lt;deskCount; i++) {\tid obj = [desks objectAtIndex:i];\tif ([obj isKindOfClass:stringClass]) {\t\tNSString* studentName = (NSString*) obj;\t\t\tNSLog(@\"%@ is assigned to desk %u (of %u)\", studentName, (i+1), deskCount);\t\t\t\t// perform other operations with the student's name\t}}Using a technique I call &ldquo;optimistic type-casting,&rdquo; we can make the code a little bit tidier.Optimistic type-casting relies on the fact that in C-based languages (unlike, say, Java), it is possible to assign a typed pointer variable so that it points to a value of a completely different type. If that&rsquo;s a little unclear, it means in Objective-C, we can do stuff like this:NSString* myName = (NSString*) [NSNumber numberWithInt:-1];Here, we&rsquo;ve assigned myName, which is declared as a pointer to an NSString instance, so that it actually contains a pointer to an NSNumber instance.Not only will the code above compile without warning, but as long as we only call methods on myName that are implemented by both NSNumber and NSString, the code will execute without crashing, and the compiler will remain silent. Calling [myName doubleValue] works just fine.This allows us to take the sample code above and eliminate the line containing the studentName = (NSString*) obj cast. We optimistically assume that the object we&rsquo;ve been handed is of the exact type we want.So, when we retrieve the array value by calling [desks objectAtIndex:i], we immediately assign it to an NSString* variable instead of putting the value into, say, the type-neutral id object pointer. Then we actually check the object&rsquo;s type to ensure we&rsquo;ve got what we want:Class stringClass = [NSString class];NSUInteger deskCount = desks.count;for (NSUInteger i=0; i&lt;deskCount; i++) {\tNSString* studentName = [desks objectAtIndex:i];\t// no cast needed for type-neutral 'id' return value\tif ([studentName isKindOfClass:stringClass]) {\t\tNSLog(@\"%@ is assigned to desk %u (of %u)\", studentName, (i+1), deskCount);\t\t\t\t// perform other operations with the student's name\t}}Doing this saves a line of code, making the signal stand out from the noise a little more. And depending on how the compiler decides to optimize that portion of the code, it may possibly reduce the code&rsquo;s stack footprint by sizeof(NSString*).It&rsquo;s not a big optimization, and even if it were implemented across a large codebase, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t make a perceptible difference performance-wise.But I use it because it&rsquo;s a little bit less text for my brain to parse through as I&rsquo;m reading my code. I also like being able to describe a coding style as &ldquo;optimistic,&rdquo; even if a more apt description of the technique would be Trust, but Verify.Evan Coyne Maloney Senior Software Engineer, Mobile Team Gilt GroupeProtip: While the example above allowed me to illustrate optimistic type-casting, it deliberately ignores a more efficient way of handling the particular problem described. In the example above, if we know that our array will never contain anything other than NSStrings and NSNulls, we can rely on the fact that NSNull is a singleton and avoid the overhead of the [obj isKindOfClass:stringClass] call altogether.Instead, all we need to do is compare the pointer of the object returned by the collection against the pointer of the singleton NSNull instance:id nsNull = [NSNull null];NSUInteger deskCount = desks.count;for (NSUInteger i=0; i&lt;deskCount; i++) {\tNSString* studentName = [desks objectAtIndex:i];\tif (studentName != nsNull) {\t\tNSLog(@\"%@ is assigned to desk %u (of %u)\", studentName, (i+1), deskCount);\t\t\t\t// perform other operations with the student's name\t}}",

        "excerpt": "Successful managers learn how to stay out of the way and let their teams work effectively and independently. Staying out the way doesn’t mean putting your feet up on your desk and playing Angry Birds on your iPad while your team does all the hard work. It means creating an environment where smart people feel empowered to recognize, own and solve problems. Here are some ideas to help you as a manger. I’ve included a few quotes from General George Patton, since apparently even our great military leaders advocate staying out of the way. Make decisions quickly. If you don’t know what to do, do something. As General Patton liked to say, “A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.” Don’t let your team stall while you deliberate on the perfect answer.Communicate what’s important: Continually communicate the metrics that are important to your organization and how they are trending. A common understanding of goals allows the distribution of decision making. George again: “If you tell people where to go, but not how to get there, you&rsquo;ll be amazed at the results”Cultivate ownership: Encourage strong ownership in all aspects of your business, but be careful not to create bottlenecks and single points of failure. Ownership shouldn’t imply dictatorship, but rather responsibility and stewardship.Just say no: Get comfortable saying no and helping others say no too. It’s much more fun to say yes but it’s as important to be clear on the things that you don’t want on your radar as the things you do. “One-half the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough - Josh Billings”Be supportive: Support the decisions of people on your team, even if you think you have a slightly better idea. The damage that you’ll do by dis-empowering someone almost certainly isn’t worth the incremental brilliance of your idea. Encourage people to disagree with you and question each others decisions. George said: “If everybody&rsquo;s thinking alike, somebody isn&rsquo;t thinking.”Foster great communication: Communication is critical in all organizations. Communication builds trust. Trust breeds autonomy. Never stop asking yourself how you can stimulate better communication both within and from your organization.Celebrate failure: As Grandpa Potts said in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, “There is magic in the wake of a fiasco.&ldquo; Encourage risk taking, celebrate failure and grow roses in the ashes of your disasters. The general once said “Success is how high you bounce when you hit the bottom.”De-emphasise roles: Precise role delineation encourages finger pointing and the blame game. Charge $20 to anyone that says “I’m a &lt;blank&gt;, it’s not my job to do &lt;blank&gt;”.Hire the best: If you don’t hire the right people, you can’t stay out of the way and all is lost. Hire smart, independent people that crave ownership and don’t fear responsibility. Hire enough great people and you might find some spare time to hone your Angry Birds skills.John Quinn, VP Engineering and Anarchist, doofdoofsf on Twitter, iphotonyc on Tumblr.",

Foreman Node ClassifierEric E Moore, from Brandorr Group LLC, gave a great demo and overview of Foreman.  Foreman is a web front end, external node classifier, and life-cycle management tool for puppet.  Eric shows us how Brandorr leverages Foreman to help with puppet configuration and administration.  He demonstrated how Foreman can be used to monitor puppet runs for errors, and track its runs across multiple servers.  It’s a great tool.  We are considering using Foreman in house at Gilt.  Eric gave us some great tips.Check out Foreman’s website: http://theforeman.org2.    Change Management and VCS work flow with Puppet.Presented by Garrett Honeycutt from Puppet Labs, this talk was focused on how to best use tools like SVN and GIT to keep all the teams that use a Puppet implementation together.   His view on it is that it’s less of a technical problem, and more a problem of change management.  He pointed out that having a good, consistent policy goes a long way here, and the positives of using test-driven development.  The slides from his talk are available here:http://talks.garretthoneycutt.com/20110413-Change_management_with_Puppet_for_PuppetNYC.pdfBoth talks were outstanding.  Made even more outstanding by the all of us heading out for drinks afterward.   The NYC Puppet Users Group meets every month, and the Systems Administration team at Gilt loves being a part of it and sharing ideas, and beer, with our colleagues at other companies.

Bouley, Corp IT SupportJanice supports all aspects of software, hardware, computer-related issues, IP and cell phone issues, and helps to make sure everyone at our company can work smoothly from day to day.  She also supports all of our Gilt City locations and Jetsetter and does remote help and phone support.When Janice is not at Gilt she enjoys traveling, partying, and doing art.  Her favorite place to travel so far has been Beijing, China, as she loves the culture, the food, and the sites!  Janice enjoys painting, drawing, graphic design, and printmaking, especially etching and photolithography.Sasha Villanueva, Executive Assistant to the CIO and CTOSasha was in the first 20 hires here at Gilt.  When she first started she was in the Marketing department, which at the time only consisted of 2 people.  From Marketing, Sasha started working with Michael Bryzek, where she was able to wear multiple hats in the office and distribution centers.  Currently Sasha is the admin for the technical department where she organizes all of the department’s logistics.Sasha enjoys dance and travel, and was part of a semi-pro Salsa dance team that performed all over the country.Molly Sullan, QA ManagerMolly is QA Manager at Gilt, focusing on front end, mobile, marketing, business operations and PMO projects. Her team includes both on- and offshore testers, which has been fun and challenging. Molly coordinates their testing schedules, and works with the engineering team to resolve any issues that arise. We have releases almost daily, so there is always quite a bit of new code to look through - never a dull moment!  At her desk you’ll find a collection of My Little Ponies… which has been nicknamed “The Ranch.”Before joining Gilt, Molly spent a year backpacking through South America and being a ski bum in Aspen, CO. She spends her non-Gilt time skiing, hiking, playing soccer and being outside.  Tracie Cheung, Project ManagerTracie is a project manager at Gilt and has worked on projects from enabling drop ship to launching the Gilt Manual. There is rarely a dull moment in the work day and the days rarely ever look the same. While not working, Tracie can be found poring over fashion magazines and blogs. She enjoys trying her hand at new recipes, photography, reading books, running, volleyball and amazing coffee houses in NYC.In high school, Tracie’s volleyball coach misspelled her last name on the team roster to “Chenug” and to this day some of her closest friends still refer to her as “Chenug” (which is much more fun to say than to read!)Kristen McGregor, Software EngineerKristen works on the engineering team at Gilt City coding both the front and backend for Gilt City and our Admin. She recently worked on the new admin calendar, and is currently working on a Gilt City redesign. Kristen loves the many components of the Gilt code, where she can work in Javascript one day and switch to a Postgres SQL statement the next.Kristen was born in California, grew up in Maine, and spent a few years living in San Antonio, TX.  She just recently moved to the big apple from Boston.  Kristen has had a bowl of ice cream every night since Junior High, and she considers herself a french fry connoisseur!  In her spare time Kristen enjoys fine dining in NYC, reading, skiing in the winter, long walks in the summer, and yes, coding :).Angela Monaghan, Project ManagerAngela spends her time at Gilt working on Distribution, Reporting, Gilt MANual, and Email projects! Prior to Gilt, Angela worked at eFashion Solutions as the Tech Project Manager and the Director of Photo Studio Operations. During her time at eFashion Solutions, she managed the launch of nine e-commerce sites and the daily operations of twenty-two e-commerce sites.   Angela has an unhealthy addiction to Starbucks; you will rarely see her without a coffee in her hand.  Angela spends most of her non-Gilt time working off the extra Starbucks calories in a kickboxing class or snowboarding!Heather Fleming, PMO DirectorHeather spends her day coordinating the various people and projects needed for Gilt while working to improve efficiency in communication and processes.  She is passionate about organizational culture and emotional intelligence and how these contribute to the overall success of an organization.When not at Gilt, you can usually find Heather on the LIRR (her commute is 2 hours one-way!).  In her free time, Heather is typically chasing after a toddler, training for a 5K and studying everything there is to know about wine… especially touring and tasting on the North Fork of Long Island.",

        "excerpt": "Slides and video from Eric Shepherd’s presentation given at Gilt HQ and at the Brooklyn JavaScript Meetup:SummaryFor modules to function within a large-scale system and on third-party sites, they need to be self-contained units with minimal dependencies. They also need to keep their hands off of other modules and library code. Gilt’s module framework manages multiple independent components, providing them with what they need, and only what they need, to do their jobs.Once the module framework is built, third parties still need an easy way to consume modules. A server-generated JavaScript bootstrap file allows all the module’s options to be wrapped in a closure, keeping the DOM clean and conflict-free. There are some complex problems that arise when embedding code this way, so be sure to watch for them!Building a JavaScript Module Framework at Gilt from Gilt Tech on Vimeo.Building a JavaScript Module Framework at GiltView more presentations from Eric Shepherd",

        "excerpt": "Cautionary Tale Told By My FriendThe QSA walked into the conference room, sat down and took out a thick beige folder labeled “PCI.&ldquo; She looked uneasy as she started going down the list of questions from top-to-bottom: - “Umm okay, requirement 8.1. Identify all users with a unique user name … Do you do that?” she asked. - “Yes, we do. However in a few cases we have to use generic accounts in our legacy systems. Access to these generic accounts is restricted and carefully audited.”- “That’s no good. You have to re-architect your legacy systems,&rdquo; she replied.She took out a gum and started chewing, staring intently while waiting for the response. At that point my friend (and a fellow CISO at an online retailer) paused and nervously sipped his tea. The next day he called the QSA’s manager and she was taken off the project. He had to search for a new QSA.What is PCI?The PCI DSS (payment card industry data security standard) was created by a consortium of credit card companies to enforce a set of minimum security standards. If your company accepts credit cards as a form of payment, then it must comply with the PCI standard. Companies who are Level 1 merchants (processing over 6 million Visa transactions annually) must undergo an onsite data security assessment by a QSA (qualified security assessor) who signs off on their PCI compliance status. Unfortunately, many organizations view PCI compliance as a “necessary evil” and aim to get it over with as quickly as possible. They will hire the first QSA that comes along who is going to check off the boxes in the PCI questionnaire and give a stamp of approval. Many smaller companies who are not Level 1 merchants are eager not to hire a QSA to save money since they are not obligated to do so. These are all crucial mistakes. You want to use PCI compliance to tighten the security in your company, and you don’t want a QSA to let you off easy. You want your QSA to be knowledgeable, fair and impartial.  The Five Questions You Need To AskBefore hiring a QSA, make sure you obtain as much information as possible about him. So before letting him come in and grill you, turn the tables around and interview your QSA.We now list the five questions that you can’t hire your QSA without asking: 1. Can you show me your CV?A good QSA needs to have sufficient security and technical skills to effectively perform the audit. Just understanding the PCI DSS specification is not enough. The best QSAs will have a background in Information Security and experience working as a penetration tester, risk analyst or a CISO. This background will enable them to make tough judgment calls, assess if your firewall configurations are correct, and understand if your compensating controls are sufficient.  Note that you can verify the QSA’s standing at the following link: http://bit.ly/bomYyZ . Also, you can use this link https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pci_qsa_list.pdf to check QSA companies which have at least one QSA who failed to perform an adequate PCI DSS assessment.  2. What types of companies have you provided assessments for?Make sure that the QSA you hire has performed PCI audits of companies in your line of business and knows the challenges that they face.   If you are in an e-commerce business, selling luxury goods online, and the QSA has only dealt with large financial services firms, he may not be the right guy for the job.3. What is your stance on compensating controls?The goal here is to eliminate QSAs who read the requirements verbatim. The only requirement written in stone is requirement 3.2 (Do not store sensitive authentication data subsequent to authorization).   All other requirements need to convey intent.  For example, it’s perfectly ok to use a compensating control if you can’t assign a unique ID to every user (requirement 8.2) as long as you document and monitor all generic, shared IDs. A good QSA will understand that, while a bad one will force you to waste valuable time re-architecting your system without making it secure just to meet the requirement verbatim. When you interview a QSA, don’t be afraid to dig in further - give a concrete scenario where your company had to use a compensating control and see how the QSA reacts.  4. How much do you charge, and what are the deliverables at the end of the engagement?The best QSAs are usually employed by the best QSA companies and they do not come cheap. Be wary of selecting a security vendor, who also happens to do PCI audits on the side, just to save a few bucks. A simple PCI audit which lasts a few weeks onsite will cost you $20K-$30K. More extensive PCI audits will cost on the order of $100K.  So if you have allocated low budget towards a PCI audit, you are setting yourself up for failure.There are two types of services which QSAs usually offer:-       Gap analysis (a.k.a a PCI preparedness exam): A QSA will assess how prepared you are for the PCI audit. He will advise you on what remains to be done, and what controls you may need to change to pass the audit. The results of a gap analysis are not reported. -       PCI audit: This is the real thing, where a QSA will request documentation, interview appropriate personnel, and assess your controls. At the end of the audit, you should expect to receive an IROC (initial report on compliance). You will have roughly 4 months to remediate any found gaps, after which you will receive a final ROC (report on compliance).  5. Will you be available throughout the year in case we have any questions?PCI compliance represents a point in time and not a permanent state of being. You will have to maintain PCI compliance throughout the year and naturally questions may arise. You want to stay in touch with your QSA auditor, maintain a good relationship, and hopefully hire him to come back the following year.  So if your QSA tells you that he is planning a two-year vacation to Hawaii or that you need to route all questions through his company’s support line, run away!   Aleksandr Yampolskiy, Ph.D. is a Director of Security and Compliance at Gilt Groupe, where he is responsible for risk management, PCI compliance, secure coding, IT infrastructure security, and security awareness and training. ",

By the time an application is built to run on 3 nodes, the node information usually has moved to configuration and services that run on 3 nodes tend to be easy to expand.So why 4? Our early systems were provisioned in groups of 4 based on load estimates&hellip; and worked great. We found that 4 servers was enough for many of the applications / servers we create at Gilt (not every application gets hammered at noon). With four servers, we can safely ramp up traffic for new applications, get real world metrics on performance based on a percentage of site traffic, and then decide how many actual servers we will need to support the full traffic of the site.",

Talks are strictly time-boxed to 5 minutes for the demo, 3 minutes for questions. Developers are encouraged to show features in action, discuss their technical design and show code snippets. Rehearsed, PowerPoint presentations are discouraged.So far it has helped developers understand what their peers are up to, and provides an excuse to talk shop over a beer or two.

        "author": "HBC Tech",
        "category": "",
        "tags": "iOS mobile iPhone",
        "excerpt": "When you’re developing an iPhone or iPad application, running the app on the device is essential to understanding whether your code is working correctly. Although the iOS Simulator is very useful for testing functionality and user interface interactions, it doesn’t provide a very good simulation of the memory constraints your app will face on actual devices. As a result, applications that run fine in the simulator may be unexpectedly terminated by the operating system when run on devices.Often, but not always, crashes that happen only on the device are due to memory warnings that are not being handled correctly by your application. Unfortunately, if your application terminates unexpectedly on the device, you’re not always given a clear indication of the cause.One tool for diagnosing such problems is the Xcode Organizer. The left-hand sidebar of the Organizer window contains a list of the various devices that have been hooked up to your computer over time. While a development-enabled device is connected to your computer, the Organizer window will show a green dot next to the device name, and the if you select a connected device in the “Devices” list, you will see a number of tabs at the top of the main part of the window.The “Device Logs” tab should show any crash logs recoded on the device for the applications you’re developing. On my installation of Xcode, however, crash logs don’t always appear there, making it difficult to determine with any surety the cause of a given crash. (I’m not sure why certain logs are omitted from the Organizer; I just know that in my experience, they don’t always show up. I’m currently running Xcode 3.2.6.)Fortunately, there is a work-around. If you sync a device through iTunes, it turns out that new crash logs are copied from the device to a location within your home directory. You can find the crash logs for your device(s) within:~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDeviceInside that directory, you’ll see a directory for each device that (1) has been synced through iTunes, and (2) had crash logs to copy at the time it was synced. (The name of the directory will be taken from the name of the device.)If a given application crashed due to an exception such as EXC_BAD_ACCESS, you should see a log file containing the name of the application’s executable followed by a timestamp indicating the time of the crash. The contents of the log file will give you more information about the nature of the problem.When the operating system terminates applications due to low memory conditions, it will create a log file starting with the name “LowMemory-” followed by a timestamp. The file will list any application(s) terminated and give clues about the memory usage of each.Even when running an application on the device within the debugger, console output isn’t always clear about the reason that an app was terminated. In those cases, the Xcode Organizer seems like the right place to look, but you might not find all the expected logs there. Syncing your device with iTunes and digging into the log files copied to your local filesystem is sometimes the only way to get the clues you need to diagnose certain types of unexpected terminations.Evan Coyne Maloney Senior Software Engineer, Mobile Team Gilt Groupe",
