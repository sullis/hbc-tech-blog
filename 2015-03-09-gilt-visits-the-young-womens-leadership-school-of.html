<meta name="description" content="Director of Product, Chrissy Fleming, and Senior Business Systems Manager, Susan Thomas, attended the &ldquo;Cool Women, Hot Jobs&rdquo; event held at The Young Women&rsquo;s Leadership School of the Bronx (TYWLS).  &ldquo;Cool Women, Hot Jobs&rdquo; is a program that is designed to expose the 6-8 grade students of TYWLS to strong, smart, and successful role models who are willing to share wisdom, advice, and experiences from their professional journey. It also provides a deeper understanding of the many career options that await once the young women graduate college. Susan was really excited to share with the girls that being a member of a Technology department doesn&rsquo;t mean that you are a coder or an engineer and that there are many options that are available. &ldquo;Everyone is their own recipe. We are all made up of different ingredients. It&rsquo;s about knowing your ingredients and then picking things you like,&rdquo; Susan says. Chrissy recalls, &ldquo;That you don&rsquo;t have to know what you want to be when you grow up, that there are jobs out there you&rsquo;ve never heard of that you might be really great at and the funny thing was, this applied to maybe 1 in 4 of the girls. The others had no problems letting me know what they wanted to be when they grow up!&rdquo; Chrissy and Susan were so thrilled to be apart of this special event focused around inspiring the young community. They can&rsquo;t wait for the next TYWLS event!" />
