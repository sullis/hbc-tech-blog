<p>Previously we’ve written about about <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/machine/learning,/deep/learning/2016/12/22/deep-learning-at-gilt">Tiefvision
</a>,
a technical demo showcasing the ability to automatically find similar
dresses to a particular one of interest. For example:</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 80%;" src="./assets/images/tiefvision-2/example.png" /></p>

<p>Since then, we’ve worked on taking the ideas at play in Tiefvision, and
making them usable in a production scalable way, that allows us to
roll out to new product categories besides dresses quickly and
efficiently. Today, we’re excited to announce that we’ve rolled out
visually similar recommendations on Gilt for all dresses, t-shirts, and handbags,
as well as to women’s shoes, women’s denim, women’s pants, and men’s
outerwear.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a brief overview. Consider the general task at
hand. We have a landing page for every product on our online
stores. For the Gilt store, we refer to this as the product detail
page (PDP). On the PDP we would like to offer the user a variety of
alternatives to the product they are looking at, so that they can
best make a purchasing decision. There exist a variety of approaches
to selecting other products to display as alternatives; a particularly
popular approach is called collaborative filtering which leverages
purchase history across users to make recommendations. However this
approach is what we call content-agnostic – it has no knowledge of
what a particular garment looks like. Instead, we’d like to look at the
photographs of garments and recommend similar looking garments within
the same category.</p>

<p>Narrowing our focus a little bit, our task is to take a photograph of a
garment and find similar looking photographs. First, we need to come up
with some similarity measure for photographs, then we will need to be able
to quickly query for the most similar photographs from our large
catalog.</p>

<p>This is something we need to do numerically. Recall that we can
represent a photograph as some tensor <script type="math/tex">P \in [0,1]^{H \times W \times 3}</script> (in other words a three dimensional array with entries in between 0
and 1). Given that we have a numerical representation for an photograph, you
might think we could so something simple to the measure the similarity
between two photographs. Consider:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{sim} (P, P^\prime) =
\sqrt{\sum\limits_{h=0}^{H-1}\sum\limits_{w=0}^{W-1}\sum\limits_{c=0}^{2}
\left(P_{h,w,c} - P^\prime_{h,w,c}\right)^2}</script>

<p>which we’d refer to as the Frobenius norm of the difference between the
two photographs. The problem with this, although it is simple, is that
we’re not measuring the difference between semantically meaningful
features. Consider these three dresses: a red floral print, pink stripes, and
a blue floral print.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 60%;" src="./assets/images/tiefvision-2/pixel-space-example.png" /></p>

<p>With this “pixel-space” approach the red floral print and the pink stripes are
more likely to be recognized as similar than the red floral print and the
blue floral print, because they have pixels of similar colors at similar
locations. The “pixel-space” approach ignores locality and global
reasoning, and has no insight into semantic concepts.</p>

<p>What we’d like to do is find some function <script type="math/tex">\phi(\cdot)</script> that extracts
semantically meaningful features. We can then compute our similarity
metric in the feature-space rather than the pixel-space. Where do we
get this <script type="math/tex">\phi(\cdot)</script>? In our case, we leverage deep neural networks
(deep learning) for this function. Neural networks are hierarchical
functions composed of typically sequential connections of simple
building blocks. This structure allows us take a neural network
trained for a specific task, like arbitrary object recognition and
pull from some intermediate point in the network. For example say we
take a network, trained to recognize objects in the ImageNet dataset,
composed of building blocks <script type="math/tex">f_1, f_2, \dots, f_M</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f\left(P\right) = f_M(f_{M-1}(\cdots f_2(f_1(P))\cdots)</script>

<p>We might take the output of <script type="math/tex">f_3</script> and call those our features:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\phi(P) = f_3(f_2(f_1(P)))</script>

<p>In the case of convolutional networks like the VGG, Inception, or
Resnet families our output features would lie in some
vector space <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^{H^\prime \times W^\prime \times C}</script>. The
first two dimensions correspond to the original spatial dimensions (at
some reduced resolution) while the
third dimension corresponds to some set of <script type="math/tex">C</script> feature types. So in
other words, if one of our <script type="math/tex">C</script> feature types detects a human face,
we might see a high numerical value in spatial position near where a
person’s face is in the photograph. In our use cases, we’ve determined that
this spatial information isn’t nearly as important as the feature types
that we detect, so at this point we aggregate over the spatial
dimensions to get a vector in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^C</script>. A simple way to do
this aggregation is with a simple arithmetic mean but other methods
work as well.</p>

<p>From there we could build up some matrix <script type="math/tex">\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{N
\times C}</script> where <script type="math/tex">N</script> is the number of items in a category of
interest. We could then construct an <script type="math/tex">N \times N</script> similarity matrix
<script type="math/tex">S</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S_{ij} = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{C-1} \left(\Phi_{ik} - \Phi_{jk}\right)^2}</script>

<p>Then to find the most similar items to a query <script type="math/tex">i</script>, we look at the
locations of the highest values in row <script type="math/tex">i</script> of the matrix.</p>

<p>This approach is infeasible as <script type="math/tex">N</script> becomes large, as it has computational complexity
<script type="math/tex">O(N^2C)</script> and space complexity <script type="math/tex">O(N^2)</script>. To alleviate this issue,
we can leverage a variety of approximate nearest neighbor methods. We
empirically find that approximate neighbors are sufficient. Also
when we consider that our feature space represents some arbitrary
embedding with no guarantees of any particular notion of optimality,
it becomes clear there’s no grounded reason to warrant exact nearest
neighbor searches.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-do-it">How do we do it?</h2>

<p>We leverage several open source technologies, as well as established
results from published research to serve visually similar garments. As
far as open source technology is concerned, we use
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a>, and (our
very own) <a href="https://github.com/gilt/sundial">Sundial</a>. Below you can
see a block diagram of our implementation:</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 60%;" src="./assets/images/tiefvision-2/block_diagram.png" /></p>

<p>Let’s walk through this process. First, we have a Sundial job that
accomplishes two tasks. We check for new products, and then we compute
embeddings using Tensorflow and a pretrained network of a particular type for
particular categories of products. We persist the embeddings on AWS
S3. Second, we have another Sundial job, again with two tasks. This job
filters the set of products to ones of some particular interest and
generates a nearest neighbors index for fast nearest neighbor look-ups. The job
completes, persisting the index on AWS S3. Finally, we wrap a
cluster of servers in a load balancer. Our product recommendation
service can query these nodes to get visually similar recommendations
as desired.</p>

<p>Now, we can take a bit of a deeper dive into the thought process
behind some of the decisions we make as we roll out to new
categories. First, and perhaps the most important, is what network
type and where to tap it off so that we can compute embeddings. If we
recall that neural networks produce hierarchical representations, we
can deduce (and notice empirically) that deeper tap-points (more steps
removed from the input) produce embeddings that pick up on “higher
level” concepts rather than “low level” textures. So, for example, if
we wish to pick up on basic fabric textures we might pull from near
the input, and if we wish to pick up something higher level like
silhouette type we might pull from deeper in the network.</p>

<p>The filtering step before we generate a index is also critically
important. At this point we can narrow down our products to only come
from one particular category, or even some further sub-categorization
to leverage the deep knowledge of fashion present at HBC.</p>

<p>Finally, we must select the parameters for the index generation,
which control the error rate and performance trade-off in the approximate nearest
neighbors search. We can select these parameters empirically. We
utilize our knowledge of fashion, once again, to determine a good
operation point.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>We’ll be working to roll out to more and more categories, and even do
some cross category elements, perhaps completing outfits based on
their visual compatibility.</p>
