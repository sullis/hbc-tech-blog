Dr. Odersky will give a presentation titled &ldquo;Scala&ndash;The Simple Parts,&rdquo; answer questions from the audience, and sign copies of Programming in Scala and his other books. Immeasurable thanks to the team at Typesafe for making this event possible. Presentation: &ldquo;Scala - The Simple Parts&rdquo;In this talk, Dr. Odersky will present what he views as the core of Scala. This core is built from a moderate number of general and orthogonal concepts that can be combined quite freely. The parts are simple, but the combinations can be as elaborate and complex as one wants to make them. Sometimes, the ideal of simplicity clashes with other requirements such as generality, interoperability, or ease of use. In every large engineering project, there are tradeoffs. This talk will highlight some of the simple principles underlying the language and also discuss some of the tradeoffs that had to be faced.

If you&rsquo;re not able to grab a spot for our event, you&rsquo;re in luck: Dr. Odersky will give his talk at Hunter College/CUNY on the afternoon of May 19 at 2 PM&ndash;register here to attend! ABOUT MARTIN ODERSKY: CHAIRMAN, CHIEF ARCHITECT &amp; CO-FOUNDER AT TYPESAFE Martin Odersky created the Scala programming language and is a professor in the programming research group at EPFL, the leading technical university in Switzerland. Throughout his career, Martin&rsquo;s singular objective has been to make the basic job of writing programs faster, easier and more enjoyable. In the process, he has personally written more lines of Java and Scala code than almost any other individual in the world. He wrote javac, the compiler used by the majority of today&rsquo;s Java programmers, and scalac, the compiler used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored Programming in Scala, the best-selling book on Scala. Previously he has held positions at IBM Research, Yale University, University of Karlsruhe and University of South Australia, after having obtained his doctorate from ETH Zürich as a student of Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal.

<p>Gilt is honored to announce that <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/odersky" target="_blank">Dr. Martin Odersky</a></strong> will speak at our New York City office on Monday, May 19! Dr. Odersky will give a presentation titled &ldquo;Scala&ndash;The Simple Parts,&rdquo; answer questions from the audience, and sign <span id="btAsinTitle">copies of</span><em><span> Programming in Scala</span> </em>and his other books. Immeasurable thanks to the team at <a href="http://typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a> for making this event possible.<em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Presentation: &ldquo;Scala - The Simple Parts&rdquo;</span><br/></strong><span>In this talk, Dr. Odersky will present what he views as the core of Scala. This core is built from a moderate number of general and orthogonal concepts that can be combined quite freely. The parts are simple, but the combinations can be as elaborate and complex as one wants to make them. Sometimes, the ideal of simplicity clashes with other requirements such as generality, interoperability, or ease of use. In every large engineering project, there are tradeoffs. This talk will highlight some of the simple principles underlying the language and also discuss some of the tradeoffs that had to be faced.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>ABOUT MARTIN ODERSKY: CHAIRMAN, CHIEF ARCHITECT &amp; CO-FOUNDER AT TYPESAFE</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Martin Odersky created the Scala programming language and is a professor in the programming research group at EPFL, the leading technical university in Switzerland. Throughout his career, Martin&rsquo;s singular objective has been to make the basic job of writing programs faster, easier and more enjoyable. In the process, he has personally written more lines of Java and Scala code than almost any other individual in the world. He wrote javac, the compiler used by the majority of today&rsquo;s Java programmers, and scalac, the compiler used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored <em>Programming in Scala</em>, the best-selling book on Scala.
